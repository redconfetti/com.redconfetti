Doing better on the song and lyric writing front. Wrote two sets of lyrics and
two new songs recently.

I'm keeping my credit card bills paid, however I had a payment for car insurance
bounce, and so they won't allow me to have a monthly payment account any longer.
I'm going to have to save up $300, or check into other car insurance companies.
I've heard that I can get a lower rate elsewhere.

Plan on calling the CPA for the company I work for soon so I can start taking
out tax percentages and reporting them correctly.

That is all.
