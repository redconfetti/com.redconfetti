# Sonoma / Napa

Visitors to San Francisco often take day trips north to

approximately 50 miles North / Northeast of San Francisco.
[Dry Creek Vineyard](http://www.drycreekvineyard.com/), just north of Sonoma, is
reported to produce an excellent Zinfandel and Savignon Blanc. Many other
wineries are located nearby as well (many of them quirky and interesting),
located very close together and easy to find on Dry Creek Road, so you can hit
up many in a single trip. At several points you'll see road side posts with
signs pointing off to various wineries on side roads. For example you can take
Yoakim Bridge Road down to West Dry Creek Road and visit
[Raymond Burr Vineyards](http://www.raymondburrvineyards.com/VisitUs-i-12-12.html)
and Preston Wineries (try the Madam Preston, amazing on a hot day).
