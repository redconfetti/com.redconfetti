I'm pretty proud of myself. I just configured PHP to compile without any
problems...well no imap support, but that can wait.

I saw that someone asked how to resolve the problem, but had no answer, and then
I realized with the help of an answer from someone else on a messageboard that
you have to install the development version of the libraries to compile certain
support into a program.

Here is my chance to give back to the Linux world by helping another newbie out
(without acting like I was above him or anything, just a newbie helping a
newbie).
