The NEXT/PREV links I'm trying to incorporate into this Blog I'm programming is
really taking a great deal of time. I've spent at least an hour sitting here
trying to work out how this would work.

I'm going to let it sit as it is and continue this tommorow. Once I'm done with
this, I'll consider the blog complete (unless there is some other necessary
update) and I'll set one up for Marshall Sontag, a friend of mine.

BTW Marshall, I made it display the most recent entries first.
