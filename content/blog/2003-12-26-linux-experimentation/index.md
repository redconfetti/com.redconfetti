Well. I've been working with Linux lately trying to understand its
in's-and-out's. At work they won't allow me to connect a machine running Linux
on it to the production network. I think I'm going to just borrow a machine and
hook it up at home.

Today I installed the Slackware Linux 9.0 distribution, thus removing the Core
Linux distribution. I still don't have any grasp of all the various things that
I have installed on here. I'm not sure if I need the Postscript things I've
seen, but I'm figuring that there may sooner or later be some sort of
dependencies on those packages, so I just let the Slackware install program
install everything, except for Gnome and KDE.

I figured that if I can't have a server connected to the network to remotely ssh
or VNC into, then a laptop with a full distribution would be the answer. I'd
much rather build the system up fr! om scratch so that I learn the dependencies
for various programs.

With the Slackware distribution it was a piece of cake to get the PCMCIA
ethernet card I'm using to work, and I'll be happy to just SSH/VNC into this
laptop I'm borrowing from my Windows-XP PC.

Linux is quite a mess with the various configurations of software, libraries,
and configuration file settings each distribution has. I can't wait to learn to
tell the consistencies of the operating system from the chaos between
distributions. For example, I'm assuming that every Linux distribution has VI on
it, but I like NANO...which was there by default on the Core distro I was using.
I'll just install it on this system...or learn to use VI.
