I always happen to come around posting to my blog every once in a while, but not
as often as others do. I shouldn't consider right now free time, given that I
have work to do on a website to work off a debt, but I'm a procrastinator and I
admit it.

Recently I was let go after the training period at AOL because I got a 37% saves
rate where a 52% was required for the 4 days I was on the phone with AOL members
wanting to cancel. Its all working out for the best though. I have a job
tommorow uninstalling a computer here in Orlando, and then I return on Monday to
reinstall it at another location. It pays $25 an hour, and its only temporary.
After that I start on Tuesday working for a company on a 3 month project at $8
an hour working on a migration project to the Windows 2000 operating system for
[Semens-Westinghouse](http://www.siemenswestinghouse.com/en/index.cfm).

In addition to having that safety net, I know that the same AOL call center's
Workforce Management department needs another person and I'm a viable candidate
for the position they are offering. They start interviewing Monday so I'm
excited about that. Funny thing is that I'll actually be hired in two notches
above the position I lost as an AOL Saves Consultant.

Aside of job issues, I'm moved in here in Orlando now. I've finised the last
driving course class needed to keep my license. Its practically suspended right
now, but as soon as I recieve the certificate of completion for that class, I'm
going down to the DMV and sorting this whole thing out. My car insurance is back
into effect as well, so as long as I have $100 in my account at the end of the
month, I'm fine.

Aside of that, I need to get to work now and make some progress on this Job
Board project I'm working on for [SuperSlow.com](http://www.superslow.com/).
Sometime in the middle of that I will force myself t or not next time I post to
this blog.
