I've been told that its clear in the way that I've been acting that I've been
stressed out for the past 3-5 months. I can only say that its soon going to be
over. I've got a nice job, and I'm going to do everything I can to make it
permanent. I'm going to pay off my immediate debts, keep my car insurance and
license in service, and start clearing up my credit. I have nothing else to say.

I need to write some lyrics. I'll do it later perhaps. I'm going to bed now.
