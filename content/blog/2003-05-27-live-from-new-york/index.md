Ok OK. Its been a whole month almost since I've left a blog entry, so here it
goes. I had financial problems earlier this month when my employer had problems
getting money from a partner in the U.K., but anyway...after I got paid, I just
did my normal thing.

My friend Marshall, planned to pick up his girlfriend that lives in New York
City using his car later in the month. Well, I decided to go with him and split
the gas, tolls, and parking fees. He took his car to a shop to have it fixed up,
but it ended up having problems after he took it into a shop. He thought he
might be able to get away with that issue, but he still needed to manually
replace his own brake pads (or something kinda of brake repair/replacement).

He couldn't get a bolt off so I decided to just use my car. We went to Walmart,
and bought some preventative maitenance tools. We were lazy and so far we've
only put! fuel system cleaner into the fuel system. It still needs an oil
change, and I've got spark plugs to perform a tune up but haven't replaced them
yet. I've been assured that I'll be able to take my car home before getting an
oil change even though its past what the car shop that changed my oil recommends
on the little sticker thats on my wind shield. If they're wrong, I'm going to be
pissed.

We left that night and cutout our plans of staying at hotel. We were able to do
this because my car is an automatic, instead of a manual tranmission like
Marshalls car. We left at 3AM on Saturday Morning and arrived at approx. 10PM
that night. We stopped along the way at some place called Pedro's South of the
Border on the border between South and North Carolina on I-95. Its like a
tourist attraction without the attraction. Major piece of shit place to stop,
not recommended.

So far since I've arrived I've seen the New York Stock Exchange, the Federal
Reserve Building, The Evil U.N. Building, Rl Park, The Woolworth Building, the
W.T.C. pit, and the Federal Hall building across from the NYSE. I took a tour of
the Federal Hall building this morning around 10:30AM.

Pretty soon after Marshall and Brittany take a shower we're going to go up into
the Empire State Building. All the other buildings I've just seen from the
outside, so this will be a highlight of my trip seeing all of NY from here.
We'll probably also go see the city from the port from New Jersey next to the
Brooklyn Bridge.

Tommorow I'm going to get up early and go see the Statue of Libery up close.
Unfortunately I can't go inside of it or anything, because of terrorist threat.
Then we're going to go pick up my car from parking, go see
[Ayn Rand and Frank O'Connor's Grave](http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=851),
and perhaps Sergei Rachmoninoff while we're at it.

Then we're off to head home with all Brittany's shit stuffed into my car. Then
we'll get to Marshalls house and I'll tell them to go to hell and that I'm not
bringing her shit up three flights of stairs....or maybe I won't mind after
riding in a car without moving for 13 hours.
