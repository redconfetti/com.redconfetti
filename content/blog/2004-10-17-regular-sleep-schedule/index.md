I've switched to days for training with Host Dime for two weeks. Its nice that
I'm on a regular sleep schedule. Hopefully I don't have any problem switching
back since I've blacked out my windows.

It was odd this morning. I didn't wake to the light, it still felt like night
time, hehe.

I watched "Team America : World Police" last night. If you've seen the trailer
for the movie, don't expect much more than a few funny moments. I'm a big South
Park fan. Actually, I think its the best cartoon ever. Many animated shows have
been created for adults to watch, but South Park is clever in how it satires
current issues and politics. Second to this is the Daily Show with John Stewart.

Check this out.

Yawn! I'm going to bed after a little more Linux+ reading.
