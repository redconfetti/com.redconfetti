I took the shoes I purchased from GBX in Ybor City two weeks ago back to get my
money back on them. I sometimes take the shoes off by putting pressure near the
top of the heel to remove the shoes, but I never put stress on the rubber sole
off the foot as to cause the sole to tear from the bottom of the shoe. They had
a policy posted that they will repair the shoe, or exchange if the shoe cannot
be repaired. Joe gave the owner a bit of guff, being really confrontational. I
think he took it a little too far. I sympathize with the owner of the store when
it comes to someone being very hostile and over-assertive.

I've never had a problem like this with other shoes, so I truly believe that the
pair of shoes that I got were not of the utmost quality that I expected. The
sole was coming off the back of the shoe after 2 weeks. I've had my other pair
of Rockports for 2 years and i'm not having this probl! em in the back of the
shoe. The manager quit talking to Joe, which I understand. He said he could send
the shoe to a repair person and then we could pick them up, but I live in
Orlando and its quite a drive to pick them up a week later. The guy offered to
have me fix the shoe here in Orlando, and to send him the receipt which he will
refund.

If the shoe repair doesn't fix it completely, and I continue to have problems
with the quality of the shoe, I am going to boycott GBX shoes, and avise that
others do not purchase them as the policy of the store along with the quality of
their shoes sets people up for disappointment. I will begin with asking the GBX
manufacturing company what they're policy is with defects, and if they have a
good enough policy then I'll only put in a report of my experience with the
Better Business Bureau.

On another note. I think I'm going to be more active in the club scene in
atmospheres I'm comfortable in with music I like, and people who I think have a
good taste. A good new hangout place. We'll see.
