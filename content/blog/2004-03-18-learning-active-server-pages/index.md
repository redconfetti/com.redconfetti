I'm currently learning ASP so I can get a job with Marshall as a programmer for
[Great Insurance Jobs.com](http://www.greatinsurancejobs.com/). I'm already on
Chapter 4 - Variables in Marshall's ASP book
[Active Server Pages 3.0](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764543636/qid%3D1079620022/sr%3D2-2/redconfetti-20)
by WROX Press Ltd.

I really hope that I get this job because it means I can get back into
programming, and give full time programming a shot. Programming from home
provided too many distractions, and that was the problem I had last time with
being as focused and productive as I should have.
