I still don't care about Myst/Uru currently. I'll pick up on it later...perhaps
after I've been invited to the online game.

As far as money is concerned, I'm not spending money on any impulses. I'm eating
food 90% of the time from Albertsons instead of fast food. I took the class
that's required so my license isn't suspended. I'm going to return the cable
modem from Bright House this weekend. I'm going to take care of my debt to
Progress Energy. I'm going to pay my credit card bills with the next paycheck.

I'm working with Linux on a laptop from work right now. I've installed Core
Linux on it, which is a core distribution without the GUI interface and plethora
of other libraries and programs that come with Linux distributions normally. I
can download and install other software as I learn the system, thus
understanding what files belong to the core operating system and which ones I've
installed.

I'm also picking up on other things. I have a book on Linux for becoming
certified, and I used it before to try to understand the Red Hat or Mandrake
installations I had made, but its making more sense now that I'm working with a
basic command line installation of GNU/Linux.

Something interesting that most people don't know is that the whole operating
system, or even most of it, wasn't provided by Linus Thorvald (the creator of
Linux).

This is how Red Hat and Mandrake Linux distributions became:

In 1984 a guy named Richard Stallman started something called the
[GNU Project](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html). Basically they didn't
like how companies created software and didn't let other people see how the
software works inside by viewing the source code. At the time of the operating
system of choice was Unix. They wanted to create an operating system like Unix
with a license that ensures open source. There might be more to it, but I'm not
completely clear on what their license says about the price of it. I know in
addition to the source code being available that any additions the code that you
make you can claim as your own thus halting the progress of the development.

Anyway, back to what they were doing. They started developing this system, known
as the "GNU system". They were working on it until Linus Thorvald came up with
the Linux kernel. The kernel is the software that performs very low level
functions such as memory management, hardware access, etc. GNU was working on a
kernel at the time, but they had alot of work to do on it still. In fact, they
didn't finish it until 2001, known as "Hurd".

So, they worked on the GNU system so it would work with this Linux kernel that
Linux Thorvald made, and released it as the GNU/Linux system. Since then many
people have organized groups to program certain things for this GNU/Linux
system. One of the most popular web servers on the net is the Apache web server,
made initially for Linux, and hence most of these servers run Apache on
GNU/Linux systems. So many many server programs and other applications,
including a graphical user interface, have been developed for that system.
Organizations have decided to package various different combinations of all this
software to make the different distributions you see.

I've worked in a text based OS interface before (DOS) and I know a great deal
about computers in general, and even I have been frustrated with GNU/Linux, but
I think I'm going to start to catch on now. Now that I'm beginning to understand
this, I'm going to make an easy to understand site on learning GNU/Linux using
the [Core distribution](http://coredistro.sourceforge.net/) that I'm learning
on.
