  content: "Good post.\r\n\r\nI am glad I read this before buying a bike.\r\nI was
    considering buying one from my local wal mart but when I saw they had Mongoose
    mountain bikes for a hundred dollars and some change I knew something wasn't right.\r\n\r\nAfter
    all Mongoose bikes are considered higher end bikes and the ones I saw at bike
    shops looked real beefy - heavy duty and the ones at wal mart looked real cheap.\r\n\r\nYou
    are right.\r\nGood isn't cheap and cheap isn't good\r\nThose are words I live
    by and so true they are.\r\n\r\nThe Marin Larkspur you have looks really nice
    especially with those saddle bags for storage."

  content: "Never ever purchase a bike from Walmart!\r\n\r\n     I recently bought
    a $149 21-speed Schwinn from the Oklahoma City West store. Out the door, it would
    not shift gears without making loud clanking and grinding noises. The owner's
    manual warned not to ride the bike with that problem. I took it back. The store's
    \"bike assembly expert\" supposedly made the necessary adjustments. Nevertheless
    it continued the same malfunction and the front tire went flat.   \r\n\r\n     Returned
    it, within a week of purchase, and demanded a refund. The customer service woman
    begrudingly made the refund when the bike expert confirmed that the bike was defective
    due to a bent middle gear.\r\n\r\n     Not learning, as I should have, I then
    purchased a Genesus 700 for $179 plus another $50 for locking cable, mirror, etc.
    The \"bike expert\" supposedly checked it out for any problems. Out the front
    door, and as I approached the busy West side intersection, I suddenly discovered
    that the brakes did not work at all. I came very close to being run over by a
    car.\r\n\r\n     I immediately went back in the store and strongly objected to
    several assistant store managers. \r\n\r\n     The \"bike expert\" was summoned
    and again took it in back for fixing. I was then assured that everything was now
    functioning correctly.\r\n\r\n     Nevertheless, the following several days of
    use saw the front and rear brakes making loud squeeling noises, dangerous grabbing
    actions, and problems with shifting up into higher gears.\r\n\r\n     Took it
    back again and demanded to speak with Store Manager Mike Hayes. The same customer
    service woman stated \"the bike expert\" will have to look at it first before
    the calling of any manager. The \"bike expert\" was summoned and took it in the
    back for fixing. I then again asked to speak with Mr. Hayes and the lady said
    \"He's not here\".\r\n\r\n     As I departed the customer service desk the same
    woman snidly said \"Well, I hope we don't have any more issues with your bike.\"
    I bit my tongue and did not return the verbal insults.\r\n\r\n     Wouldn't you
    know it, after no more than a quarter mile from the store the brakes started malfunctioning
    as did the gear shifter.\r\n\r\n     I intend to return the bike when the store
    manager is present this coming week. After that, I will write a strong letter
    of protest to the Regional Manager.\r\n\r\n     In conclusion, I say again, never
    ever buy a bike from Walmart! Doing so will most likely be an unpleasant experience,
    if not also result in danger to your physical safety."

  content: "Ooh, you got snookered by your local bike shop, friend. Maybe not intentionally,
    but if \"the cable for one of the derailers was very loose\" then you'd not have
    been able to shift to the largest cogs at all instead of having to \"avoid certain
    gear combinations\", and if one of the chainrings was bent the chain might skip
    to a smaller chainring, but you wouldn't throw the chain because of it unless
    the derailleur stops were misadjusted. The wheel bearings were no doubt dry (they
    almost always are on any new bike) but almost certainly not \"going\" - it takes
    about 3,000 miles before dry bearings will damage the races in the hub.\r\n\r\nMost
    bike shops charge ca. $80 to \"assemble\" a new bike. New bikes arrive from the
    factory substantially assembled and adjusted. For $80 the shop (should) adjust
    the high and low derailleur stops (so you don't throw the chain), lube the cables
    and adjust the tension (so that shifting gear to gear is quick and smooth), adjust
    the brake pads so that they're flat on the rim with a little \"toe-in\" (so that
    they don't squeal, which is annoying but not dangerous), repack and adjust the
    wheel bearings (which somehow always arrive too dry and too loose), and tighten
    spokes and true the wheel (rarely necessary). Basically, your LBS quoted you the
    price to assemble a new bike, with a \"fudge factor\" to cover the possibility
    that something really was damaged on the bike. They also convinced you to replace
    a perfectly serviceable $150 bike with a shiny new $450 bike. (Yay?) \r\n\r\nI
    know this because, among other reasons, I just bought a Huffy Savannah for $40
    from someone who sounded just like you. It has low-end (Tourney group) Shimano
    shifters and derailleurs, a 6-speed (!) Falcon freewheel, JoyTech hubs, and Wellgo
    pedals. Nothing to brag about, but except for the freewheel (Falcon is prone to
    fail, as you discovered, but 6-speed freewheels are very obsolete and Shimano
    no longer makes them) it's indistinguishable from any entry-level bike at your
    LBS.\r\n\r\nExcept, that is, for the adjustment. Two hours of elbow grease (I'm
    no pro) and a couple of dabs of lithium grease (hubs, headset, and cables), and
    mine rides smooth as smooth can be. There's nothing wrong with a \"Walmart bike\"
    that 2 hours (= $80) of a mechanic's time can't fix. And that's the REAL difference
    between Walmart bike and your LBS.\r\n\r\n(BTW, except for the rear derailleur,
    you're riding on Tourney components now, too.)"

    then you might have a case. I can only think that you should consult with an attorney
    to see if that's so.

People warned me to not buy a bicycle from Walmart, but I needed a bike and
didn't have the money for a $300+ bicycle at the time. Shortly after purchasing
the bike I had to replace the freewheel after it got locked up. Huffy did ship
the replacement freewheel to me at no additional charge because the bike was
under warranty, however Walmart isn't a real bike shop which does adjustments
and repairs, so I had to arrange for help in getting the old freewheel off and
the new one on.

![Huffy Savannah](./huffy-savannah.jpg "Huffy Savannah")

More recently the chain started to come off, and I'd have to put it back on
getting my hand all dirty and greasy, and avoid certain gear combinations so it
didn't continue to happen. I figured it just needed to be adjusted or something,
so I took it into a local co-operative bike shop -
[Missing Link](http://www.missinglink.org/). At first the girl who looked at the
bike noticed that the cable for one of the
[derailers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailleur) was very loose, and that
I'd need to make an appointment for them to check it further. I did this and
brought it in the following Thursday. Another guy looked at it more thoroughly
to draw up an estimate for me. He pointed out that the chain was coming off
because the [crankset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crankset) was bent, and that
they could try to bend it back. He also pointed out that the foot pedals were
shot, the bearings on the back wheel seem to be going. He estimated between $80
- $120 to get it in better condition. I didn't want to do this, and then have to
shell out more again due to other issues which would crop up after another 2
months of riding.

I decided to go to their retail shop (across the street from their repair shop),
and check out my other options. I ended up buying a Marin Larkspur hybrid, as
I'm looking for a good street commuter bike to get me around until my Isuzu
Rodeo is repaired (after I save up approx. $2000). They recommended that I get
something with strong wheels such as this model. I'm a pretty heavy guy, so
strong wheels it is.

![Marin Larkspur](./marin-larkspur.jpg "Marin Larkspu")

I ended up paying $460 for the bike, and then re-investing into a new rack for
the back, a solid U-Lock (instead of a cable lock), and front and rear lights
for night time riding. I would have used the other lights I bought from Walmart,
but they broke from the tension I put on them mounting them to the new bike. It
doesn't matter anyway. The new lights mount properly and I can easily take them
off when I part the bike somewhere, so they don't get stolen.

I love my new bike. I like how I can bring it back to the bike shop and they'll
fix it up for the next year. Also I like knowing that the bike shouldn't have
any problems like the Huffy. Over the weekend I used the new bike to go do my
laundry.

![Bicycle Laundry](./bicycle-laundry.jpg "Laundry loaded in bicycle")

So anyway, I've been taking my new bike into work and parking it next to my old
bike. I really need to get rid of the Huffy, but I'm not sure what to do with
it. A friend of mine suggested that I take it into Walmart and ask for a refund,
store credit, or something. I checked for the
[Walmart return policy](http://walmartstores.com/7658.aspx) online before

I left and went all the way over to the Walmart in Oakland. The policy online,
and at the store, does not state that bicycles are an exception. At the store it
does cite that there are terms regarding certain electronics/computer items. The
lady at the custom service desk told me that they will repair the bike, but do
not accept returns if the bike has been used. I asked how I can get it fixed,
she said the group of people which can fix the bicycles are not available
tonight, but will be available tomorrow (I'm not available tomorrow night). I
checked for signs back by the bicycles, and also around the custom service area,
but nothing pointed out this exception in writing. I don't have my receipt with
me, so I decided to not try to fight it, because I'm sure they'd call me out on
that technicality.

I still don't want to go all the way back there just to be defeated, so here it
is online for everyone to know. Walmart will not take back the low quality
bicycle you buy from them. If you're going to buy a bicycle from them, I hope
you consider it expendable. I bought a $70 Roadmaster mountain bike from Walmart
back in 2007/2008, and it had issues with the brakes, and other minor things,
but it was only $70 so I figured you get what you pay for. I didn't think that
after only 2 months of riding a $150 Huffy that it would come to this. I'm going
to just donate the Huffy to an organization or someone in need.... but I know
now to tell others that seriously, if you want a bike...wait till you have
enough money and buy a good one from a bike shop that will maintain and repair
the bike...because a Walmart bike will only end up in the trash.

Update 01/03/2012: I continued to ride the
[Marin Larkspur bike](http://www.marinbikes.com/) for several months as my main
transportation. This bike has not had any issues what-so-ever. It's worth
investing in a nice sturdy bike that won't break on you, even if you ride it
daily.
