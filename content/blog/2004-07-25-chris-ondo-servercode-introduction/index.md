Last night was really cool. I went downtown to the office of ServerCove.com with
my friend Chris Ondo. Him and I are going to start experiment with Linux with
help from the owner of [Server Cove](http://www.servercove.com/) at their office
on Saturday nights.

Rick, the owner, hooked us up with free co-location of this shitty little
Pentium box that I bought to use to learn what we're focusing on (web server
configuration).

This may at some point turn into an employment opportunity, which is exciting,
but even if that doesn't happen this is a nice opportunity to expand my
knowledge of computers.

I have to give it to Chris Ondo, he actually took initiative to contact the
owner of Server Cove to "intern" there. He told me about it and I had him ask
the owner if I could come along too. Thanks Chris.

I know a good amount more than Chris knows about Linux, so I can bring Chris up
to speed with what I know and then we can work together to learn things and
share it with each other. Like say, I learn how to properly setup scripting
where a new user account automatically is created an FTP account under the web
server space, and he can teach me whatever he learns about DNS or whatever he is
working on.
