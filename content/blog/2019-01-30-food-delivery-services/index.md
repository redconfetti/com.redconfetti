It's becoming clear to me that there are many different types of food delivery
services that people are using, many obviously start ups that are testing out
markets (especially in the San Francisco bay area).

I decided that I should start to organize a list of them for reference later,
because it's easy to forget about them. Also it would be nice to have a list so
that we can notice when
certain ones go away.

* Prepared Meals
  * [Territory Foods]
  * [Freshly]
* Tailored Meal-Kits
  * [Home Chef] - Provides low-carb options
  * [Blue Apron]
  * [Plated] - Economical meal kits ($4.78 per serving)
  * [Every Plate] - Economical meal kits ($4.99 per serving)
  * [Hello Fresh] - Advertises shorter prep time
  * [Sun Basket] - Caters to healthy / organic consumers (Paleo, Lean & Clean,
    Gluten-Free, Vegan, and more)

    Vegan lifestyle
