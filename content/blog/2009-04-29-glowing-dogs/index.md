![Glowing Puppy](./glowing-puppy.jpg "Glowing puppy")

It turns out that scientists in South Korea have somehow
[inserted fluorescent genes into a dog egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zSZDjRUXA),
and implanted the eggs into some mix breed dog. What was born was puppies with
somehow glowing faces and bellies.

Doesn't this cause some sort of problem for the dogs to sleep properly? I wonder
if this is the case, or if the dog isn't able to detect the light it emits.
