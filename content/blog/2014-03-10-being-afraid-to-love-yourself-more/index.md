often. A friend of mine shares these quotes often. Recently James posted the
following.

This brought out something from me that I've just been wanting to put out there.
For a long time, I was afraid to do what people said you should do. That
something that you should do being to learn to love yourself. I've heard it said
"you have to love yourself before you can ever love someone else". I rebelled
against this, and dismissed this many times, because I was afraid that it would
make me even more numb to love. I thought love was the longing for someone, the
desperate wanting for someone to validate, to hold me, to love me, to fill the
hole that has been within me for so long.

I feared that without that attachment that "love" wouldn't be as sweet. But
truthfully, that's just a recipe for a roller coaster, and really its better to
not be dependent on someone else for validation.

After you learn to accept yourself, you can see clearly that you don't want the
first person you can trick into loving you... you want that person who really
does complement you, and it doesn't matter how long it takes, and how many
people you have to meet that don't complement you, and perhaps outright reject
you. Because you know it's not about you, it's just that they're not the one for
you, and that's fine. Why they're not is none of your business.

The people who don't see this, stay stuck, like I did, for years, afraid to go
out and meet people, because they were confused and knew that going out and
talking to people meant rejection, and that the rejection meant depression and
isolation to recover from the emotional wounds, and further reinforcement of the
belief that you're not worthy enough of someones love. But it's that belief,
that low self esteem, that state of being, that is hell, and it's one that is
maintained by the attitude of trying to get someone to validate you.

Trying to get someone to help show you it's not true, that you're lovable,
isn't the way. You won't believe them. You have to find it yourself. You have to
find how to be fine with yourself.
