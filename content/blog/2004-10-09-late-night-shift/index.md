I've been working for Host Dime for over a week now. The late night shift is
really taking its toll on me. I really love this job, but if every other day is
hell because I was unable to get more than 4 hours of sleep during the day, then
I'm going to have to ask them to put me on a day shift or something.

I'm feeling fine right now. I'm going to start coming in at 10:00PM - 6:00AM.
That way I won't be exposed to daylight before going to bed. Perhaps this will
help me tremendously. We'll see.

Aside of that I'm learning alot about Linux. This is a great opportunity for me
to expand my skill set and to enjoy doing it at the same time.
