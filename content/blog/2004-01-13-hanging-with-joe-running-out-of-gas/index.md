Joe and I went to a small club downtown tonight to watch some electronic group
play their re-produced music. Not very exciting, but we didn't stick around for
the headliner.

We hung out with his friend Lee, a pro-audio instructor at Fullsail. Before
doing that Joe and I rocked out at his place...Joe on drums, me on acoustic
guitar and vocals.

I ran out of gas on the way home. Cops drove me to the gas station and back. I
got a warning about my soon to be expired license plate. Much props to the
Orlando cops for giving me a warning after all the bullshit I've been through
with the Altamonte Springs cops.
