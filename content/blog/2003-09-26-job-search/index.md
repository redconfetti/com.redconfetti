Well. That thing over at Seimens-Westinghouse didn't work out. I made the
mistake of asking what arrangements can be made if I get another offer (from
AOL). I'm not sure if I asked just Spherion (the temp agency I'm working
through) or if I actually asked the person interviewing me. Anyway, I'm not
mentioning anything like that again at any interview.

Aside of that, I did that Ad-hoc work over the weekend, which put $197 in my
bank account making me just $15 shy of paying my rent for this following month.
My room mate [Marshall](http://pillarofrationality.blogspot.com/) owes me $100
still, so I'm sure he can pay $15 for me, along with any bills that come up.

From the looks of it though, I've found a job at some place near Orlando
international airport that requires a background much like mine (internet tech
support) that pays $15 an hour. Its only for tw! o months, but it might turn
into a full time thing. If I don't get any vibe that this job is something I can
stick around for, then I'm going to take the AOL workforce management job if I
get the offer.

I'm really looking for a place that I can get involved with, enjoy going to
work, and that pays enough for me to settle my debts. I took count and I'm
around $10,000 in debt (estimated tax money from this and last year included).

As far as non-work related news, I'm interest in meditation. I went to a
meditation group with Marshall and Brittany, and it was interesting. I asked a
few questions and got a clearer idea of how things work. I really need to gain
more focus, attention, and volition. I need to break my habits. Quit smoking,
quit eating out of boredom....quit succumbing to any destructive desires, and
start emersing myself into productive yet enjoyable activities.

Today I worked with music, but ! didn't get far. I learned a tidbit more about
Microsoft Excel, but lo 13, I read a few news articles linked to from
[Fark.com](http://www.fark.com/). I looked for a job up until getting the call
from Spherion about the job by the airport. I smoked cigarettes. I didn't get
much produced, and I felt depressed about it. I get free time like this and I
waste it. I should have been working on
[Ken's website](http://www.superslow.com/) for the job board project. I should
have been learning more about Excel. I should have cherished this free time.

I'll bring more attention to it.
