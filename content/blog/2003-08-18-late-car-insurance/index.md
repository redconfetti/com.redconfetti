Ok. I'm back up on alert again. My father called me today and reminded me of my
late car insurance. Last time I spoke with the people at State Farm they told me
that I'm still covered, but I'm not covered by now. My father said that they'll
take my tag away from me for not having car insurance, and so I called the
insurance company. Turns out that I need $200 to re-instate my insurance, and it
will be $300 to re-instate it after the 23rd of this month. I have $80 to that
means I need $120 more. I'm sending my resume out and calling back places I've
sent the resume to.

My dads pressuring me to take any job I can since I can't find any computer
related work. Its not going to be in my best interest to find a job at Burger
King while I'm trying to get into a customer service position making 50% more an
hour. I'm back on crisis alert mode. Damnit...
