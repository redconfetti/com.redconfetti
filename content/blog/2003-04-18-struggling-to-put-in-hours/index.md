I've been neglecting to work as much as I should. I've been neglecting to work even two hours for many days at a time.
Its ridiculous. Today I am going to begin learning CSS. This will allow me to format pages easily and in more detail,
while also lowering the amount of time I spend editing font tags and such to format text.

I see that other PHP applications use style sheets, so I believe its important that I do so as well.

I'm going to try to incorporate such new things into my work schedule from now on, to keep myself interested and
motivated to work.
