I'm hanging out with my friends right now, Bryant, Fran, and and Bryant's friend
Raman. We're just chilling right now listening to
"[The Ministry of Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVutrPKcGgE)" by the
Eurythmics. We just got done listening to
[Eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFxMXlZYbo) by the Smashing Pumpkins, and
[The Box (Untitled Version 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DCRLZcjw2E) by
Orbital. Earlier today we went canoeing. It was really nice and peaceful. It was
Fran's first time canoeing.

Now I'm listing to [Coma White](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQPJYnr48yU) by
Marilyn Manson.

Now [Perfect Drug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSLqeZzTU8I) by Nine Inch Nails.
