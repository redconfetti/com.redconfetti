Yesterday I went to Antigua's after work with most of the people I work with. I
got a nice buzz with beers covered by my boss, and then I left and went home at
7:30.

The beers wore me out a bit and I was tired, so I went to bed at 10:00 PM, and
woke up at 12:30 AM.

I had plans to go to Server Cove last night, but I ended up going back to the
office I work in at 2:00 AM, to consolidate all the computers there into parts
and machines, and throw away the junk. I got back home around 7:00 AM, and I
plan on staying up until 4 or 5 PM today.

The plan is to make my sleep schedule rotate so that I get up at 2 AM, shower
and eat, go into server cove or work on things in peace and quiet from 3 to
7:30, then go into work at 8:30, and then come home at 6:00 and sleep.

I don't know if this will be a good idea, but I'll try it for a week if I can.

Well today while I'm awake (if I can manage to not fall asleep) I plan on
formatting this Dell Dimension XPS P133s (Pentium 133mhz, 64mb RAM) and then
installing Linux on it using the
[Linux from Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) documentation as a guide.

The guide I believe tells you to use a normal distribution such as Red Hat or
Mandrake, and I guess its going to have me strip it down, but I'm going to skip
that and just install the
[Core Linux distribution](http://coredistro.sourceforge.net/).

Yawn!
