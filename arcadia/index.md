Maxwell Keyes: Teenage Angst? What are we against? Are we never going to be accepted? Is this America the land of the
free, yet with de facto social classifications? Am I destined to the same lifestyle and financial limitations as my
parents? As I see it, since my parents cannot put me through college, I will never succeed in this world. As I see it,
I will be a slave, working in food production, amongst the lower class. I have not been bred as an Epsilon, or a Gamma
either. I am a Beta.

Right now my favorite book is Brave New World. Somehow I see that its called a dystopia, but I like the idea of
technology used to better the world. If I was conditioned to what I was predestined, I might enjoy my life better.
This drug Soma also has a certain appeal to it. Sounds like the real world drug Ecstacy. Also sex is no longer a big
taboo. Men will no longer hold themselves to this conformist idea of fornication, and people will not feel so nervous
about the issue any more.

And they wonder what is teenage angst? What are we against? A cynical world? A world where it is implicitly expressed
that knowledge is limited, and we aren't capable of doing that the wealthy and intelligent can do.

Where only a gifted minority has the privledge of attending part of the public school suitable for a growing mind? All
that matters is being socially accepted, having children, and being taken out to a fancy restaurant by your significant
other.
