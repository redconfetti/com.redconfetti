I've been cleaning up my computer lately...removing files I can live without (a
little grudgingly since some of them are too much to keep, such as my Daria
episodes). I plan on backing up what is most important and converting my main PC
over to Linux. I'll still be able to use Dreamweaver and Photoshop for the web
work I do once in a while using WINE, but I'll be able to learn this operating
system with a nice fast machine.

I've been hanging out with this guy from work named Joe too. Joe is such a cool
guy.. END OF TRANSMISSION
