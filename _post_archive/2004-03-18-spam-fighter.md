If you're tired of SPAM, I recommend [SPAMfighter](http://www.spamfighter.com/).
Its a plugin for Outlook Express. There is a free version that I've been using
that you can download.

"Each time you download your e-mail, the system automatically checks your e-mail
against the SPAMfighter database of known spam messages. If a message is
identified as spam, the message is automatically moved to the Spam Folder. "

There are other methods that SPAMfighter uses to identify the email as SPAM, but
they're kept confidential. I'd say that it filters out at least 85% of the SPAM
I receive.
