Well. I partied a little Xmas night (Thursday) after going to my grandmothers
for Xmas. The next day I got up and went to work. I had a bad cough, but I
thought it was from the cold air...yeah...thats the ticket.

Anyway, work wasn't so bad because we just sat watching movies on call. Then
Saturday came, I was getting a little worse, but I thought it was just a cough.
Turns out that that night it got worse and turned into a runny nose, a few
sneezes, etc. Here I am now with congestion, runny nose, cough, slight body
aches...yuck!

I'm not going to work tommorow. It will be the first day I've called in for my
new job at Devereux.

I still need to settle things with Ken Hutchins as soon as possible. I think
whats going to happen is that I'm going to work on his website after work each
day on whatever they need for the "changes" that are being made. I'll! end up
working it off bit by bit over time.

Rodney called me recently, saying he's ready to start paying me what he owes
me...etc etc. I'm not sure if I'd like to go back to web development now that I
have this job and I'm focusing on it. I started reading a book on Network+, and
right now I'm also learning about the GNU/Linux system. I told him to continue
calling me and keeping me updated, and I'll keep him updated. I don't know what
to do though. Rodney has the web development work, and the recording studio...
but I don't know whats up. I'm not going to give up the perfect setup I have now
for less pay (given that this job pays a little more after taxes are taken out)
in a state where it costs more to live, unless its completely worth it.

I should look forward to taking a trip to California some time...then I can make
my decision. I need to see this studio, and see whats really going on. Rodney
sounds like a cool guy and all...but sometimes things seem a little fishy. Maybe
it too good to be true. Maybe I'm just under rating myself.
