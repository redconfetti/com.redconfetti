I went to Joes house Friday night. We tried to summon a spirit from the ether
using a ouija board I ordered on Ebay. I payed $5 plus $14 shipping for it. Its
funny that I got it to see the $0.99 mark on it in a sharpie marker, clearly a
garage sale markup.

Anyway...either it didn't work because no one believed it would work, or there
are no ghosts. We'll just have to find a more spooky area to visit to summon the
ghosts. Perhaps a public park I know of that is in Pine Hills that used to be
the grounds for an insane asylum.

After doing this, I read a ghost story that I found chilling on the [shadowlands
website](http://theshadowlands.net/).

[Evil Spirit](http://theshadowlands.net/ghost/ghost21.htm#evil) is the story
that I found chilling. The idea of a person seeing a friendly ghost, but others
knowing the true evil identity is a very interesti! ng concept for a ghost
story, even if I don't believe in ghosts.

After reading this story I played my songs the ways they're meant to be played
on Joe's acoustic guitar. The next morning Joe told me how much I have helped
him gain an active interest or motivation for music. I told him that its going
likewise as far as his improvements in drumming. I plan on buying a [Digidesign
MBox](http://digidesign.com/products/mbox/main.cfm) soon ($500 retail)...
instead of going for the $2000
[Digi002](http://digidesign.com/products/digi002/main.cfm).

This way I'll be able to finally learn to use ProTools software, and I'll try to
get the hookup for effects and other plugin software from Joe's friend that
works in the audio industry.
