"The freedom of experience is the adventure of Being...You can't experience this
wonder, through, if you hold onto a particular identity and frame of reference,
if experience continues in its rigid habitual grooves. Wonderment arises when
you are open to something that is mysterious, new, and fresh, when your old
knowledge is completely suspended for the moment."

This is what I want. I can somehow tell that my own judgmental stances are
keeping me from enjoying my life like I used to. I hear something, and it
reminds me of something that embodies trite, old, stale, overdone, etc...I don't
have time for it. There is so much for me to process in this life, I must filter
out the shit. So I filter out the crap music...and for good reason...but there
are likely many things I throw out...many babies thrown out with the bath water.
A song reminds me of Creed, or sanitized adult contemporary crap (Michael
Bolton), or...so many lame things... and I can't listen to it. I stopped
listening to songs that were good even, but I didn't want their influence
corrupting my artistic vision of the type of music I wanted to create.

So many experiences ....
