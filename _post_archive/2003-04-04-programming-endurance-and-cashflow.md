Well. I've been working hard, working more hours than my lazy as was previously
able to bear. I'm proud of myself, but I'm still not up to the mark of working
at least 6 hours a day. I'm close to 4.

I recently played the game Cashflow, and I'm very soon going to start budgeting
myself. As soon as I get paid, all money will be spent on necessities and credit
card debt. No extra money will be left for me, except for a calcultated amount
for things such as going to the movies or whatever.
