Well. I've moved three loads of things from my house to my grandmothers. I've
been staying here even though I have my room in Orlando still. I figured getting
myself settled here as soon as possible will ease the transition.

All I have left at home to do now is to clean, sell my desk and dresser set, and
to somehow transport my bed to here at my grandmothers house.

A cheap desk can always be bought, but a nice bed isn't something I can easily
replace. I learned the hard way how much it sucks to let things go because you
don't want to be bothered with moving them, and then later needing them and
having to repurchase those things.

I'm going to continue to consolodate things, such as winter clothes, and old
books that I don't need. I don't want to take up too much space here at my
grandmothers. Really I don't need that much, but I have lots of books and
keepsakes. Also I've got old computers that aren't worth much that I need to
decide what to do with.

I called Howie today. He said that all his friend are really impressed with his
song that I laid most of the guitar on in the studio last Thursday. Even the
sound engineer, Jason of Audio Recording Services in Winter Springs, was very
impressed with the song. I really enjoy working with Howard. There has always
been a great chemistry between us.

I'll feature the mix down of the song later in a sample or whatever Howard
thinks is best to provide online.
