I'm trying to schedule myself each day to do certain activities. It all begins
with scheduling my work outs every other night, or even after two nights.

I've been starting my day playing GTA Vice City on Drew's PS2 because I'm droggy
when I wake up, and I enjoy playing the game while I get used to my awake state.
I usually sleep between 3am - 11am, or sometimes I'll stay up till 5am and
sleep till 1pm.

I'm working on improving that however. I'm going to try to devise a plan where
I move to a 9am - 1am sleep schedule without making myself tired for many
days....

...I recently upgraded my computer with a new motherboard, Athlon XP 2100
processor, 512MB DDR RAM, a new case with a modified plexiglass cutout on the
side and two red LED fans.

In addition to this I also recently purchased Windows XP Professional, Norton
AntiVirus 2003, and Microsoft Word 2002. Next thing on my to do list is to
purchase Macromedia Dreamweaver MX, and Adobe Photoshop 7.0.

Thats all for now. See ya!
