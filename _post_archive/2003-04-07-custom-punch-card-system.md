Yesterday I created a punch-in / punch-out timecard script which stores all
shifts as records in a MySQL database. I created it so I wouldn't have to use a
little timer program to time myself, and then type that time into a text file. I
was neglecting to record when I worked as well, so there was no record of that.
Now I can see what day I worked, and during what time period. Also I'm able to
leave a short description of what I did during that time period.

The only problem I have with the punch card system is that I can't pause the
clock so I am timing bathroom breaks, drink breaks, etc. I'm on a salary system
anyway, so as long as I don't keep the clock ticking while I play video games or
work for someone else, there isn't a problem.

I also set one up for Drew. It wasn't the purpose of the timecard script, but as
a side benefit I'm more motivated to put some tim! e on that punch card. I might
expand this code into a password protected punch card system, with punch cards
for individual projects we're working on. Those punch cards might have an option
for client viewing...No real plans for expanding it into a project management
system, but I'm thinking about it.

On another note...I'm keeping up with my work as I should.
