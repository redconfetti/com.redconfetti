Went to Ali's house last night. I've known Ali since 10th grade. We used to talk
about music and computers in my Pascal programming class. Bought a computer from
his friend Wendell for $50. Plan on bringing it upstairs into the office at work
sometime today to start installing Slackware on it. Let the Unix learning begin
again.
