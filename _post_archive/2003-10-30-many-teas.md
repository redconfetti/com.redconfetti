I get paid tommorow. I just worked a 15 hour day yesterday, so I'm sure to get
some overtime next week. I'm using the money I get tommorow to pay rent, and the
rest is for food and gas. The check which follows will go towards select bills
and debt, and then I will save some for more food and gas.

Yesterday I spent $22 on various Chinese teas, including Green Tea. I paid about
$6 for a box of tea which [sells online for
$12](http://allgreenteas.com/~allgreen/cgi-bin/cart.cgi/THSGG332.html)

I just checked my bank account balance from Marshalls laptop because my computer
is being fixed. I just bought a new motherboard, but then I found out that I
need a compatible video card. Anyway...it shows Oct 31 already with my pay
already added....strange.

Anyway...I purchased some [Chrysanthemum
tea](http://www.teaspring.com/Chrysanthemum.asp), [Oolong
tea](http://www.oolongtea.org/e/health/index.html), Jasmine tea, and
[Antihypertensive tea](http://www.fareastimporters.com/antea.html).

If this tea doesn't actually promote my health or something, at least I will
know that I've tried these different things and I might even like the taste.
