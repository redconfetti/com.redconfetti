It seems to me, in my experience, that there are two types of pain.

There is the pain you create through a process of having negative thoughts,
which result in anxiety or emotional pain, and then a combination of the thought
and feeling continues to cycle the same types of thoughts and same feelings. You
can exercise and eat better, which will help your body feel better and make you
less prone to this cycle, but at the same time you must try to stop these
thoughts. Realize that they don't serve you, they only stress you, cause the
pain.

The other type of pain is the type that is repressed. It surfaces in various
ways and influences our behavior. It causes us to unconsciously defend ourselves
in various ways, brings about behavior we wish we didn't have. We hate ourselves
for the behavior, and because pain isn't pleasurable, or on some level we mix it
up with the type of pain we create, we avoid it. We eat, or smoke, or anything
else we can to avoid it. Ultimately the rule is that if you allow yourself to
feel it, it will be gone and you will be more at peace.
