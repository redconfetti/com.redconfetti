Here are my notes on how to use the Elektron Digitakt. These notes are to help
remind myself later, but could be useful to new users.

I highly recommend the [Mastering Digitakt Complete Bundle][] by Dave Mech.

## What is the Digitakt?

The Digitakt is an 8 voice digital drum computer and sampler.

Is it designed to be a Groovebox, or just a sample based drum machine?

* 8 Audio Tracks - Represented by the top row of [TRIG] keys (#13), labelled 1
  through 8.
* 8 MIDI Tracks - Represented by the bottom row of [TRIG] keys, labelled 9
  through 16.

## Creating a New Project

The Digitakt supports Projects, which contain multiple Patterns.
Each Pattern consist of 16 different tracks, with 8 tracks using internal
sample sounds, an 8 tracks dedicated to external MIDI devices.

Press the Settings button (#4), and use the arrow buttons (#11) to select
Project from the screen menu. Press the [YES] button (#8) to enter the Project
menu. Choose 'LOAD PROJECT' and press [YES]. Navigate to 'CREATE NEW' and press
[YES]. It may ask you to save changes to the current project. It will display
"Initializing Project", then return to the Project menu.

Next select SAVE PROJECT AS, then press [YES]. Choose an empty slot then press
[YES]. A screen will appear allowing you to name your project. You can use
the arrow buttons (#11), and/or the Level/Data encoder (#21) to set the name
for your project before pressing [YES] to save.

## Loading Samples

Press the [SRC] button to load the Source screen. Most screens display 8
controls, with 4 on the top row, and 4 on the bottom row. The Source screen
