This aren't going completely peachy. I don't have car insurance right now,
however my credit card payments are up to date.

I've been having problems staying focused and ambitious at work, however I'm
applying myself still to get back into the flow of things. Lots of personal and
professional frustrations are contributed to those problems.

In the meantime there is something to be happy about, I've found a download for
The Fantastic Adventures of Unico. Download a Bit Torrent program, and [click
