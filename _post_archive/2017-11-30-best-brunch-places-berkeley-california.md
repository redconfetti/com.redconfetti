I just had a co-worker that is a long time Berkeley area local tell me about a
practice that her and her husband have done -- BBC (Brunch, Bike, and Coffee).

She gave me an awesome list of places that are great for brunch.

## Doyle Street Cafe

[5515 Doyle St #10, Emeryville, CA 94608][10]

> Hearty dishes like sandwiches & quesadillas along with an all-day breakfast
> menu in a low-key space.

This is a great spot I like to take people to for brunch. I really like their
menu.

## Au Coquelet

[Website][16]

[2000 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704][11]

> Casual eats like sandwiches & pastries are available in a laid-back setting
> with late hours & WiFi.

This is my favorite restaurant in all of Berkeley. They are open until at
least 1:30 AM every day. They have coffee, tea, beer, wine, cocktails,
desserts, burgers, hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, quiches, salads, soups,
pizza, nachos, chicken tenders (tendies!!!), buffalo wings, chili cheese fries,
fish and chips, and a breakfast menu (hawaiian omelet and huevos rancheros
being my favorites).

They have brunch on weekends until 3 PM, with my all time favorite being the
Blackstone Eggs Benedict. It comes with home fries that I like to pour Cholula
hot sauce over.

## Aunt Mary’s Cafe

[Website][14]

[4640 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94609][13]

> A cozy local cafe serving homey comfort food with a Southern & Southwestern
> twist in an airy space.

## Betty’s Seaview Dinner

[Website][15]

[1807 Fourth St, Berkeley, CA 94710][12]

> Landmark neighborhood diner dishes out breakfast classics with a twist, like
> soufflé pancakes.

## Brown Sugar Kitchen

[Website][20]

[2534 Mandela Pkwy, Oakland, CA 94607][1]

> Updated renditions of soul food classics like fried chicken & waffles served
> until 3 PM daily.

## 900 Grayson St

[Menu][19]

[900 Grayson St, Berkeley, CA 94710][2]

> Buzzy spot for updated comfort food

## Doña Tomás

[5004 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94609][3]

> Mexican fare gets a contemporary spin at this colorful cantina with a
> festive courtyard patio.

This place is pricey for dinner, but the breakfast is more reasonable,
she claims.

## Tacubaya

[1788 Fourth St, Berkeley, CA 94710][4]

> Sophisticated preparation of Mexican staples with Niman Ranch-sourced meat
> plus vegetarian options.

This place has the same owner as Doña Tomás.

## Bakesale Betty

[Website][17]

[5098 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94609][5]

> Lunchtime bakery is a popular take-out stop for hefty fried chicken
> sandwiches & classic desserts.

I've had brunch here. They definitely have a menu you should check out.

## Paradise Park Cafe

[Website][18]

[6334 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94608][6]

> Convivial, family-friendly cafe for locally sourced & organic Californian
> comfort eats, beer & wine.

## Lama Beans

[Menu][8]

[1290 6th St, Berkeley, CA 94710][7]

> A casual cafe that dishes out American, Southwestern & Middle Eastern
> favorites & breakfast all day.

I've had brunch here at least twice while waiting for my motorcycle to get
serviced at [Berkeley Performance Motorcycle][9] nearby.
