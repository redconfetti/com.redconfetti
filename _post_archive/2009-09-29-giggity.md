I thought it was quite funny today that as I was reading the transcript of thirteen year old
[Samantha Gailey's grand jury testimony](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0610081polanski1.html) describing
how Roman Polanski gave her wine and quaaludes, then proceeded to rape her, this Quagmire banner showed up at the top of
the Smoking Gun website page.
