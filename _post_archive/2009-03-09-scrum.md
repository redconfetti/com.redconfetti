Okay. I'm not going to claim to be a super go-getter developer, but I like the
notion of being cutting edge and able to provide the best to new clients. I also
like it when the tasks I have to perform to not look too overwhelming. It
appears that cutting edge developers are following a set of guidelines for
project planning and execution called Scrum which is simple, flexible (or
agile), and gets the job done faster and with the fastest return on investment.

Check it out and do the math in your own head. It will make sense how simple and
concise this project planning technique is.
