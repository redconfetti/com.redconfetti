  content: Hi Jason - fellow Web developer and aspiring motorcyclist here. :) How's
    the GS500 treating you? It's topping my list right now - adding to my little stable
    of 125 and 150cc scooters. Had my heart set on a Silverwing, but I'm starting
    to think motorcycle. The TU250 looks cute but I'm afraid the 250cc will leave
    me wanting more (I am happiest cruising at 65+, even on my 125cc!). How upright
    can you sit on it?

  content: "The GS500F is treating me well. Riding on the highway feels no different
    than riding my car on the highway. I feel that comfortable...unless it's raining.
    I did the rain at 65mph and I was fine, so I might get less tense doing that when
    it happens again.\n\nThe GS500F is sports-touring, so I'm more upright than others,
    but I'm still bent over a little. I'll need to develop strength holding myself
    up a bit so I'm not putting much stress on my wrists. I'm kind of thinking that
    I should have gotten a cruiser, as it would have been a little easier on my wrists.
    I'm getting numbness in left hand...and I work on a computer all day...some nerve
    is being pinched but I'm not sure where. Then again, they say that cruisers aren't
    as easy to control through turns, which relies on shifting your body weight.\n\nYou're
    able to cruise at 65+ on a 125cc, and you're happy doing so? I bought the GS500
    because someone told me that at highway speeds it would whine and vibrate, and
    thus not be enough. \n\nNow that the bike feels not much different than driving
    a car, I'm ready to just settle into just cruising and finding new places to visit.
    I'm taking a trip to Las Vegas on the 16th - 23rd. The one thing that gets me
    though is that I don't have much storage space. A scooter might have been nicer
    in this regards. I need to buy a rack and a box so I can put my helmet and other
    gear away inside it, so I don't have to carry stuff with me into places I visit."

Again I woke up this morning with plans to set a new precedent, a long range
highway trip. My friend Babak had to get ready for work around 4 PM, so it made
perfect sense for me to visit him in San Jose early in the day and then make it
home before nightfall.

The first couple times I've gone on the highway the feeling of the bike changed
in a way which caused me concern. The wind blew at me and seemed to make the
bike feel more unstable, and when I went on concrete that had slight grooves
going in the same direction I was going the bike seemed to wobble in a weird
way. It seems to cause the bike to wobble like it does when you go across a
bridge that has a steel grate. When I first noticed this I had thought that
perhaps something happened to my front tire or something...because it felt like
the wind pushed me to the left or right easily.

Well, I found out that the bike is more stable when going at higher speeds due
to the increased [gyroscopic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope) force. The
reason why the bike felt like it had less grip on the road was because I was
slowing down out of fear. When you're going faster, the bike wants to stay up,
and it takes a little more effort to turn.

I've also realized that at lower speeds turning only requires leaning your body
over a bit, but on the highway the counter steering they teach you in the
[Motorcycle Safety Foundation](http://www.msf-usa.org/) - [Basic Riders
Course](http://www.msf-usa.org/students.aspx#brc-brc) (to turn left, push left -
to turn right, push right) applies much more.

After riding on the highway for a while I seemed to be less scarred, accustomed
to the speed in which things were moving, and felt more in control. It's much
like when you're driving your car and you come off the interstate highway after
going 70 mph for hours. When you get on city roads you feel like you're going
slow, and it's tempting to exceed the speed limit a bit. Also I'm sure it helped
that I made sure to put a good 3-4 seconds of space between myself and the car
ahead of me, and made sure that I was always in a position where I had a lane I
could change to in an emergency (or the right shoulder of the highway).

A tactic I put to use quite a bit was making sure that I wasn't in someones
blind spot...and at least if I was that I was far enough behind them that if
they decided to make an abrupt lane change that I'd have enough room to just let
them go for it. If it seemed like I couldn't make that much space, I'd give the
bike some throttle and push myself up into the view of the motorist on their
front left (so they'd know that I'm there).

At first when I got on the highway I camped out in the far right lane and was
going only 65 mph (the speed limit), but people were passing me. It feels a bit
less safe having people pass you, changing lanes, etc. than it does to just find
a slow lane and follow someone at a safe distance. It wasn't long before I felt
comfortable going 70-75 when traffic was going that fast.

On the way there I saw a guy on a Harley wearing one of those half helmets,
going 80-85 mph in the fast lane / carpool lane. I don't think I'm ready go be
in that lane, going that fast, just yet. Especially while I only have a 487cc
engine that seems like it's really working to push itself in that range.
