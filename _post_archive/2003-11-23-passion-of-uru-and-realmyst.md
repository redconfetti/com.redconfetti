I have certain things that I'm into with a passion, and I drift in and out of
these phases when such things have new developments. Ever since 1994 I've been a
fan of the game Myst. I've read The Book of Atrus, and The Book of D'ni, and I
own the audio version of the Book of Ti'ana. I've played Riven and Exile. I at
one time in my life wanted to learn to model 3D worlds myself, but I've decided
that I need to just develop a story of my own and leave the actual production up
to others with my supervision.

Recently [Cyan Worlds](http://www.cyanworlds.com/) (previously just Cyan) has
released [Uru: Ages Beyond Myst](http://urulive.ubi.com/US/), and so I've
purchased it and I'm getting all back into the story and thirst for exploration
and discovery.

They previously released [realMYST](http://www.realmyst.com/), a real-time 3D
version of the original Myst game with a new addition called the Rime age.
realMYST used an engine previously dubbed Headspin, now Plasma, which they
purchased from a company named Headspin Technologies. __Uru: Ages Beyond Myst__,
uses a newer updated version of that same engine called Plasma 2.

There are some puzzles in the game which I do not think I would have found
without consulting a walkthrough, so I try to solve them without help, but I
consult the walkthrough when its necessary so I don't go mad playing the game.
I'm in it just for the sights, sounds, and storyline.

I see that there is a lack of overhead maps for the game when it comes to
creating walkthroughs. It looks like people will have to hand draw maps to
provide such a nice guide to solving the puzzles, even though this is a real
time 3D game and hand drawing these maps aren't 100% completely necessary.

In realMYST I've seen vario! us configuration file changes that have been made
to alter the gravity even the realMYST developers did not intend.

I'm trying to do this right now with Uru, but it looks like they've tightened
down on the possibility of a game hack so people don't cheat (more importantly
online).

All I really want to do is get an overhead screenshot to use as a map for
plotting the location of various resources in Photoshop.

I'll continue my hunt.

On another note, I'm going to start using Saturdays as my free time day, and
Sundays as my chores/business obligation days. Lets see if I actually stick with
that plan. Today is Sunday and I'm doing this crap...I really shouldn't but I
do. :(
