Well. I'm still working on CGM, currently developing a business directory system
for them. I've been such a lazy procrastinating idiot lately, finding it hard to
lift a finger to do this. I need to treat this website like its my own, and
treat it like all the other things I treat with higher priority. I will say that
working with graphics is more fun than working with code. Code can be fun too,
if its something new. Oh well...I'm producing. I just need to drink some
caffeine, turn on all the lights (keep myself awake), turn some music on, and
start coding away.

I did good last night. I was feeling really depressed because I was being so
lazy that I wouldn't even go to the store and buy stamps to send in my car
insurance. I got pissed at myself, told myself I'm not going to read any
websites for leisure, I'm not going to watch any movies, or anything else thats
been distracting me. I orga! nized my room (I need a clean environment to work),
and I even cleaned my bathroom a bit. I got those stamps. I still haven't taken
the envelope to the mailbox. I'll go do that now....as well as pay my rent and
deposit a check.

Then I'm coming back and I'm working.
