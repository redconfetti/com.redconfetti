Hello

This is my personal blog where I muse about anything. I have always been interested
in the internet, music, and psychology / spirituality.

I am a website developer, with a tech blog at [Ruby Colored Glasses](http://www.rubycoloredglasses.com/)

I am currently a student of the [Diamond Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._H._Almaas#Diamond_Approach).
