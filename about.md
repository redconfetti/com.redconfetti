My name is Jason. I am a website developer living in Erwin, TN.

I contribute to a Ruby / Rails blog called [Ruby Colored Glasses][]

I was formerly a student of the [Diamond Approach][].

I play guitar and keyboard, and produce my own [music].

I'm also currently learning [powered paragliding][] on the weekends.

I came up with the name 'redconfetti' long ago when I was trying to come up

> Maxwell Smart: I don't understand.

> Chief: Well, whenever KAOS wanted to contact their agents in a different city,

> street and the color of the confetti determined their instructions.

> Chief: How?
>
> Chief: Green confetti meant that they were supposed to go ahead with the
> proposed plan. Red confetti meant stop instantly.
>
> Maxwell Smart: Well that's fantastic, Chief. How did you ever find that out?
>
> Chief: Well, they also used white confetti. That meant 'Danger, leave the
> country immediately'. Fortunately for us during their last parade it snowed.
>
> Maxwell Smart: And they all left the country?
>
> Chief: No, they all went to Miami.
