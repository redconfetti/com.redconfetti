My name is Jason. I am a website developer living in Berkeley, CA, originally from Orlando, Florida. I contribute to a Ruby / Rails blog called [Ruby Colored Glasses](http://www.rubycoloredglasses.com/).

I am currently a student of the [Diamond Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._H._Almaas#Diamond_Approach).

I also play guitar and keyboard, and produce my own [music](http://music.redconfetti.com/).

Not that I purposefully used the name 'Redconfetti' because of this, I find it interesting that it's in
[this quote](http://sharetv.org/shows/get_smart_1965/quotes/pg-8) from one of my favorite shows growing up (it was
on Nick at Night), Get Smart.

> Chief: It's KAOS confetti. This is how they contacted their agents.
>
> Maxwell Smart: I don't understand.
>
> Chief: Well, whenever KAOS wanted to contact their agents in a different city, they'd hold a parade. Now the agents
> would pick up the confetti from the street and the color of the confetti determined their instructions.
>
> Chief: How?
>
> Chief: Green confetti meant that they were supposed to go ahead with the proposed plan. Red confetti meant stop
> instantly.
>
> Maxwell Smart: Well that's fantastic, Chief. How did you ever find that out?
>
> Chief: Well, they also used white confetti. That meant 'Danger, leave the country immediately'. Fortunately for us
> during their last parade it snowed.
>
> Maxwell Smart: And they all left the country?
>
> Chief: No, they all went to Miami.
