# Jekyll

This site is generated using [Jekyll]. I'm choosing to use it because I'm fluent
in Ruby development, and it's pretty simple to use to implement changes.

## Theme

This site uses the [Jekyll Theme YAT] theme. See [Jekyll Theme YAT Demo].

## Index Content

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and
re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many
different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which
launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit
numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the
file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source
for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```jinja
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
```
