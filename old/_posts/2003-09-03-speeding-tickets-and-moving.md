Well. I'm really tired right now, and I'm getting up at 7am to start all over again. We've finally found a house we're
going to move into. I still have past due amounts for my two credit card accounts, $150 owed to Wachovia, $20 I owe my
friend Will, $1370 I have to work off/pay back for a business associate (much thanks to him for helping me in this time
of crisis).

I have to take a $40 driving class and pay a $180 fine so I'll have my driving license still.

Fucking assholes gave me 3 speeding tickets for going between 11 and 13 mph for each ticket. I asked for an extension
since I'm broke, and Hearing Officer Deen denied my request. I'm hell bent on bad mouthing the government now. They need
me to pay for their bad accounting and new office furniture each year, and I have no say in the matter like I do with
McDonalds or Burger King. I have to do business with th! em because my life depends on it. They practically have a gun
to my head saying "Pay $180, and take a $40 class, and remember we're being merciful here, or else we'll suspend your
license and you'll have to live on the streets."


So anyway...things look like they're working out. Thanks to that business associate, I have car insurance coverage
still, I don't have late fees accumulating for my old apartment, I was able to rent a Uhaul to move recently, and I've
had food in my stomach.

I just moved out of my old apartment at 521 One Center Blvd. #102 in Altamonte Springs, FL. My room mate, Drew Baye,
moved into a one bedroom apartment in the same apartment complex. My friends that I'm moving into this house with are in
this apartment till Sept. 10th, so I had nowhere to put my furniture and belongings except for in their living room.
They're on the 3rd floor. My calf muscles are really sore, and we'r! e going to have to move all this shit downstairs
into another moving t its over and my bedroom is situated. I'll just go to work each day, and get my finances in order.

Hopefully my other business associate which was sub-contracting me to work on his website will come around sooner or
later and I'll be able to pay off my credit debts and pay off my tax debt that I have with the government.

We'll see what happens. The job I'm training for right now has the potential to pay extremely well along with many
other benefits (dental, 401-K, tuition reimbursement).

My immediate goal, no matter now long it takes, it to get rid of this debt and start school. If things work out with
Rodney, I'll move to California and take classes in music production while I work in his recording studio. Otherwise,
I'll stick with this routine and take classes to get my Associates of Arts degree.
