Well. Its Monday. On Friday I got let go from Spherion because I didn't meet the sales quota required to graduate from
training. I still have another paycheck coming, so I'll be good for a bit. Rodney says that he'll have money for me soon
so I can begin work for him again. We'll have to see what happens there.
