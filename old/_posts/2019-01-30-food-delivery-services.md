It's becoming clear to me that there are many different types of
food delivery services that people are using, many obviously
start ups that are testing out markets (especially in the San
Francisco bay area).

I decided that I should start to organize a list of them
for reference later, because it's easy to forget about them. Also
it would be nice to have a list so that we can notice when
certain ones go away.
