Well. I borrowed some money from my grandmother and bought some food because I'm broke and waiting for my boss Rodney
to pay me. Its been a month, and I recall him saying that Drew and I would see something by the 28th of July. He
promised that there would be something the first week of August, so I'm going to start applying for a job now, and if he
pulls through I'll just turn down the jobs.

Right now I'm applying to Bright House Networks, which provides my Roadrunner cable modem service. I hear they have a
very good call center that is ran well, so I might even keep this job while doing the web development on the side. We'll
see.
