Things are working out better now. My domain name is back up and running, so I may now recieve email. I'm going to get
an online resume up very soon with links to demo applications (including this Blog which I programmed myself).

My power bill is paid, my rent is paid, and soon my cable modem bill will be paid.

Beth might come over today to hang out...She leaves in a couple days to move up to South Carolina for college.

I don't know what the fuck we're doing with this house we're supposed to move into. We need to give the guy $200 so at
least we have the house on hold (and since we plan on giving him $200 anyway if we don't use the house).
