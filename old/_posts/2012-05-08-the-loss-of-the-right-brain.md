I've spent so long in my left brain trying to build my knowledge of computers, the world, trying to figure it all out
...trying to relieve this anxiety, fear, sadness. My right brain has atrophied, I'm cut off from it, I feel dead
because of it. I pursue spirituality to help me get it back, but I still haven't found it quite yet. How sad it is
that our culture requires this of us, how it cuts us off of our innate talents of imagination that we felt and enjoyed
as children.
