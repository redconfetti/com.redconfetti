I've been getting back on track lately with programming like I should. I haven't finished the admin for Superslow.com's
Study Guide yet, which I need to do since they've paid me for it already, but I'm working on a secure-form/processing
system that we can use in multiple parts of the website. I'm thinking about not charging them, and owning the system
myself to use for other websites. I'll have to think about it.

With compassglobalmusic.com, I'm working really hard to get the whole admin debugged. I've finished the Dance Culture
module, and I'm working on the Hip-Hop module currently. I worked really well on Monday, and worked OK on Tuesday, but
today I slacked off again. I've made progress though. I'm going to push myself more and more tommorow.

To give myself a challenge, I'm going to look into Windows programming. I learned C in high school, which helped me
to learn PHP, and working with PHP has made me more comfortable with programming. I might take an interest and get
caught in the flow of learning the WinAPI. We'll see.
