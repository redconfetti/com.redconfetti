Not last night, but the night before (Friday) I went to Chris Ondo's birthday
party. As expected Ondo setup his big PA speakers and played the music louder
than what is acceptable. It was turned down eventually and things worked out. I
drank so much beer that I had a hangover all day yesterday.

I planned to go with Chris to Server Cove and help them move all their computers
to their new NOC, however they cancelled because of rain forecast.

Today I'm probably going to just learn how to configure the server we've got
colocated for proper FTP access, and try to configure Apache to use PHP.
