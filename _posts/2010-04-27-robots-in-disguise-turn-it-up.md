I must say I love [Robots in Disguise](http://www.robotsindisguise.co.uk/), an
electro punk band from England.

I got turned onto them by their single '[Turn It
Up](http://www.robotsindisguise.co.uk/music/turn-it-up/)', which I discovered on
Last.fm.

I decided it was time that I give the other songs a listen on Grooveshark, and
I'm finding that they're not just an underground one hit wonder. I urge anyone
who loves electronic pop with a punk/rock edge, check this girl group out.
