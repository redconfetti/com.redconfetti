I recently went to sign up for yet another service, and I was forced to agree to their terms of service. Who really
reads those things anyway? How can a person quickly determine if there is anything negative about those terms?

It seems like there needs to be a sort of Consumer Reports organization, but for the Terms of Service. It turns out
there is, and it's called [Terms of Service; Didn't Read;](https://tosdr.org/about.html)

I wonder if it's possible to get a rating on their site for [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/terms-of-use/)

I also discovered that there is a service called [Flattr](https://flattr.com/) that makes it possible for people to
support your website with donations. I think I'll sign up for this soon.
