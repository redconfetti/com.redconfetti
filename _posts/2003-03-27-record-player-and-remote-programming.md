I've been proactive recently. I cleaned the kitchen and living room completely
(with a minimum of effort on Drews part) and it seems as if Drew and Emma might
try to keep this apartment clean in the future.

Recently bought a record player for $40 so I may play the few records that I've
bought myself, and also to put the late 70's rock albums my parents gave me.

Most of these artists some people have never heard of. I also recently bought
the classic album **Switched on Bach** by Wendy Carlos. She has also done
soundtrack work for Clockwork Orange, The Shinning, and Tron.

I still haven't been very proactive when it comes to the most important work I
have to do for my main employer, APG Media Group. I told my boss, Rodney, that I
would keep track of my hours but I've failed to do so. I've been keeping up with
his expectations, but seriously he cou! ld find someone more competent than me
so I need to get my act together. I've made it clear with Rodney that I'm going
to be honest however, as he is naive to the amount of effort it really takes to
do what I do.

I'm going to start working like I should and reporting the hours to him. I'm
going to get my act together. I've decided that I'm not going to allow myself to
sign onto AIM until I've got my work done because that is a distraction. I'm
also going to bar myself from excessive amounts of news reading (especially the
[Fark](http://www.fark.com/) and [The Onion](http://www.theonion.com/) news
sites).

Blog to ya later.
