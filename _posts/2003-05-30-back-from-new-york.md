I just got back from New York City last night. I'm really surprised that my car
didn't have any problems all the way there and back.

I went up in the Empire State Building like I said I would, but no view across
the Hudson at the city behind the Brooklyn Bridge. We didn't go to Ayn Rands
grave site either. The view from the Empire State Building was awesome. The
highlight of the trip like I said. I saw the Statue of Liberty in the distance,
and it looked really small. Marshall is afraid of heights, so he wouldn't step
even two feet away from the edge to look down at the city. There was a big gate
twice as tall as us that wouldn't let anyone jump over if they wanted to. He
tried to tap himself, but it didn't work.

The next morning I walked from 80 John Street down to Battery Park where I took
the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and then to Ellis Island. Unfortunately I
couldn't go into the statue museum or into the statue itself because of the damn
terrorists.
