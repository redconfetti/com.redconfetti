My car is in the shop right now, getting checked out by a mechanic to see what is wrong with it. I could put $2500 into
it to fix it, or I could pay $960 to pay off the car and get the title, then donate the car to some charity (so they
can salvage it). I'll have to see what the damage is when I talk to the mechanic on Monday.

I've been thinking, if the car is beyond reasonable repair, I think I'll donate it and get a scooter. The question is
which scooter? I know I want a maxi-scooter that I can use to cruise across the country if I wanted to.

Options I am considering are:

1) [Kymco Xciting 500Ri](http://www.kymcousa.com/showroom/scooters/xciting500ri/index.html)

MSRP: $ 6,300 / $6,800 with ABS

Engine: 498cc

2) [Yamaha TMAX](http://www.yamaha-motor.com/sport/products/modelhome/607/0/home.aspx)

MSRP: $ 8,600

Engine: 499cc
