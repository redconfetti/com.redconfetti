  content: Just dropped by to see what is new. It's time for an update! Went through
    all the pics, there are some really good ones in there. Listening to your music,
    I'm to Slowly Dying and enjoying them, except Rabies is a bit wild for my taste;
    but then again, it is rabies.

ok. Again I'm starting over with a fresh new blog. I hope to keep this one going, never take it down, yada yada. I'll make sure I take a database backup in the future, along with the data.

Anyway, I'm back. I'll be blogging about anything: web development, spirituality, life in California, food, whatever.
