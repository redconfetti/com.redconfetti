  content: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI think not only the one you mentioned, there are other
    very good alternatives to the application as well. We had been using Replicon's
    <a href=\"http://www.replicon.com/time-tracking-software\" rel=\"nofollow\">time
    tracking software</a> solution which is hassle free, fast to implement cloud
    based solution. There are no paper or Excel forms to deal with, and everyone can
    enter their info from anywhere with a web browser."

  content: "Thanks for the feedback, Harvest looks nice.\r\n\r\nDuring my own research
    I came across this copany doing the same for a bit less monthly fee.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.billgrid.com/signup\r\n\r\nAlthough
    I must admit I'm a little doubtful about the quality of their product judging
    from the dubious font usage on their site.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    ). It provides invoicing, billing, advanced order management and purchase order
    management for small, medium and large businesses. It is very easy to use and
    is under USD $10. One can try it FREE before deciding.

    (http://www.nutcache.com/) beats them all. You have everything for
    free, no limits.

  content: Yeah, but it's still $20 a month minimum to maintain the account. Can you
    pause it so that you're not paying for very low data storage when you're not actually
    using it to invoice clients?

  content: When I started my company, my friends recommend slickpie(http://slickpie.com).
    I have been using it for 8 months. I send my invoices and it works so well. Now
    I turn invoices 10 times per year and not longer have cash flow issues. It's 100%
    free online accounting software. Easy to use.

I've been using [Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/) for time tracking and invoicing of clients for over a year
now, but I'm finding that the $19.95 a month pricing is a bit high for someone like me.

I have a number of various clients that ask me to do work on their website, and recently someone wanted me to teach
them PHP via Skype. These are all projects I'm doing on the side, outside of my normal day-time job hours, so I'm not
bringing in a lot of money with these side projects. I'm one guy with several clients, but each client might be one
small job that pays about $100-$200, sometimes like $400. At $19.95 per a month that comes out to approximately $240 a
year. I might have brought in about $1000 this year, so that $240 is cutting into about a quarter of the income it
helps me produce.

Because of this I decided to look for a more competitive, yet equivalent replacement. I was almost sure I had found
this through [Curdbee](http://www.curdbee.com/), but they do not have an API or reliable error free time tracking
method. I'm used to using the Freshbooks dashboard widget for Mac computer to keep track of the time. I don't have to
worry about accidentally closing my browser window and loosing the time I've already tracked during one session, and
even if I forget to clock out and shutdown the computer, when I start the computer up again I see that it continues
from the time that it saved the start of my session. In such cases, which do occur at times, I'm able to modify the
time with a fair estimate and submit the time. Having a desktop widget or application that works like this is key to
tracking time for each task I work on, and later on invoicing the client for the work (with detailed task-by-task time
tracking).

I believe I've found a worthy competitor of Freshbooks for my time tracking needs in
[Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/).
