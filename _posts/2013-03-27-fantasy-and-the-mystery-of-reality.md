When I was a child I remember having some sort of curiosity, and other subtle
feeling that I consider pleasurable, that arises when I would see something
presented as esoteric, and possibly magical. Sacred geometric art, pyramids,
accounts of alien contact, etc, can sometimes bring up this feeling. I remember
watching [Unsolved Mysteries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsolved_Mysteries),
narrated by Robert Stack, in the late 80's and early 90's (my formative years),
and really feeling drawn to the sense of mystery in the stories.

I can only see this as a possible reason why people are attracted to medieval
fantasy like Lord of the Rings, The Sword in the Stone, or the [Dragons of
Atlantis](https://www.kabam.com/games/dragons-of-atlantis) game. I can think
that perhaps some sort of catharsis might exist when one imagines a simpler time
devoid of technology. These things might have those benefits for some, but for
me it's these types of things applied to a possible reality that intrigue me.

Surely there is a skepticism that I've developed for mystical falsehood.
Fundamental religious propaganda, such as that of the Baptist Christian
persuasion, can instill much fear in a young child. As a child becomes more
aware of the world, and questions such authority, resentment and a strong sense
of rejection can take over. For me this occurred, and it resulted in a strong
identification as an 'atheist'. Nonetheless, even today I avoid fortune tellers,
as I've never had an experience which showed such ability in seeing the future
to be true. This doesn't mean however that seeing this illustration of a
[fortune teller](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Fortune_Teller) doesn't elicit that
kind of feeling of mystery in my heart.

This seems to give the sense of a wise old person, that may be eccentric, but
that understands magic. In fantasy you can suspend a sense of disbelief, which
means that in such a context you can feel this reaction to this image. But why
do we feel this?

I'm really curious about our real history. What is the origin of [playing
cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card), or tarot. Why were hearts,
spades, clubs, and diamonds chosen? How did we discover the tarot?

What do you feel when you see this
[pentacle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentacle)?
