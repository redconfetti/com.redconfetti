I found this video in an [article by Sarah
Chang](http://www.themuse.com/advice/the-easy-way-to-boost-your-health-even-when-youre-sitting-all-day).
As a person who sits all day at work, this is a useful reminder with tips on how
to improve your health by adjusting your work setup.

If you use a Mac computer at work, I recommend [Time Out
software](http://www.dejal.com/timeout/) to remind you to get up and stretch, or
go for a walk around the office.
