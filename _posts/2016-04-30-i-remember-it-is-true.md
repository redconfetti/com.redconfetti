I remember working, being driven, by the desire for actual accomplishment. It is
true that this was about me wanting to have a real world sense of value, not one
that was just recognized by others, but also one held by me.

I remember feeling that in the moment, that was part of me, during the process.
I remember my plans to perfect the machine that was the shared hosting wing of
the company. I remember envisioning how well our team could be trained to help
the customers we supported, how trouble free the billing system that I was
replacing would be, and how much we would be able to start actually advertising
because we could finally have that capacity.

I worked hard for 4 years towards this goal, only to have the order I had
brought, the carefully engineered mechanism disregarded, used to fulfill some
other ungrounded agenda - the company owners vanity fulfilled by expanding the
company to other countries of which this billing system was not designed to
handle.

What I really mean is that I was hurt. I trusted the people I worked for, the
ones I was helping, to respect me, to reward me, allowing me to achieve that
goal, but it was a trap. I didn't know if the owner purposefully planned it, but
it was a trap. I was nothing more than a digital janitor, cleaning up after his
messes, and there he was about to make another mess.

My heart and soul was given, and now I don't know if I can do that again. Not
without it in writing.. and that's just about compensation for my value offered.
I don't know if I can get the respect I'm wanting. How do you get that in
writing? How can I trust? How can I shine again if I cannot trust that it will
be recognized? Why do I need to be recognized? How much of it is mere ego that
thirsts for it, and how much of it is the true thirst of my soul?

I just want people I can truly trust. So my heart can be open. I want to be seen
and valued, not coddled. This isn't ego. This isn't imposture syndrome, but
those that I can't trust make me feel that way. It's about them, not others like
me.

I want a work family. I want people I choose, I trust, to feel real.
