For those out there that are familiar with the song [Under the Milky Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWxJEIz7sSA)
by The Church, which is definitely one of the highlights of the Donnie Darko soundtrack (that's how I became aware of
the track), I recently discovered that the same band recently covered 'Disarm' by The Smashing Pumpkins.
