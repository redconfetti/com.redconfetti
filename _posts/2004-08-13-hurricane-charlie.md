Hurricane Charlie will hit Orlando soon.

Here is an image of it only 17 minutes ago.

I'm right on the red star shown on the map. I looked up my address on [Yahoo maps](http://maps.yahoo.com/) and I resized
the image to fit over the weather service image.

Went into the studio to record guitar on three tracks for Howard, however we only got the music for two songs recorded, no vocals or guitar.

I'm going in after work next Thursday to do my part. Pretty exciting!
