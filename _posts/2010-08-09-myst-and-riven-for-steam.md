I just went to the Cyan Worlds website, to read about their release of The Manhole for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and
iPad. I never played the game, but for $2 I'll play it now.

Amazingly enough it has been YEARS since I played the sequel to Myst, Riven.

I just saw that they are working on bringing Myst and Riven, and their other games, to
[Steam](http://www.cyanworlds.com/products/index.php) soon. I hope this means I'll be able to play these games on my
Mac sometime soon.
