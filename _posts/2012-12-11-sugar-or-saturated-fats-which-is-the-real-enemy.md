[146 Reasons Why Sugar is Ruining Your Health](http://www.rheumatic.org/sugar.htm)

From [The Vegetarian Myth](http://books.google.com/books?isbn=1604860804), page 207:

> The pieces of the disease puzzle started coming together as early as 1885, when a German researcher found that
> "sixty-two of seventy cancer patients were glucose-intolerant."
>
> By the mid-1960s, scientists were observing that insulin stimulated malignancies to grow.
>
> In 1967, Howard Temin, a Nobel prize-winning cancer researcher, found that without the presence of insulin,
> cancerous cells didn't grow. Other doctors noted the concurrence of diabetes and breast cancer. This was in
> 1956. And yet we've been told repeatedly to eat that high-carb diet, with its requisite insulin overload.
> "Low-fat, plant-based" is the endless round of rosaries that our public health institutions have to offer. In fact,
> prayer probably would be more effective &mdash; it could hardly be worse.
>
> Another researcher, Robert Stout of Queen&rsquo;s University, Belfast, showed how insulin both increases the
> transfer of fats and cholesterol into the arterial walls and promotes the synthesis of fat and cholesterol within
> the arterial lining. In 1969, he co-authored a paper with diabetologist John Vallance-Owen, blaming 'large
> quantities of refined carbohydrates' for all of it.
>
> He would go on to show in 1975 that insulin triggers the growth of the smooth muscle cells of the arteries, the
> beginning of high blood pressure and arteriosclerosis. Scientific studies had noted the concurrence of diabetes and
> Coronary Heart Disease as early as 1929.

Page 170:

> There is a huge array of epidemiological studies that show no correlation between saturated fat consumption,
> cholesterol levels, and heart disease. Let's look at some of those first, not because I think they're so great as a
> concept, but because proponents of the Lipid Hypothesis love epidemiological studies so much. First are all the
> paradoxes: the French Paradox, the Greek Paradox, the East African paradox, the Swiss Paradox, the Pacific Island
> Paradox. These countries have high levels of saturated fat consumption, but low levels of heart disease. France has
> one of the highest&mdash;the French consume four and a half times as much butter as US Americans, for
> instance&mdash;but the French have substantially lower CHD.
>
> The Masai of Kenya eat a diet almost entirely of meat, milk, and blood. On average, young Masai warriors ingest 300
> grams of animal fat every day. Yet their cholesterol levels are some of the lowest found anywhere&mdash;averaging
> under 160&mdash;and heart disease is unknown.
>
> On autopsy, atheromas (bad arterial plaques) were absent. George Mann, the researcher who studied the Masai, was led
> by his findings to declare the Lipid Hypothesis "the public health diversion of this century ... the greatest scam
> in the history of medicine."
>
> A study of the Samburu tribe of Uganda yielded similar findings&mdash;neither heart disease nor levated cholesterol
> levels, despite a daily diet of 400g of animal fat. They also had no rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative arthritis,
> or high blood pressure.
>
> Another African pastoralist culture is the Kalenjins of Kenya. Raw and fermented dairy products form the bulk of
> their diet. Not only are they free of chronic and degenerative diseases, they are world-renowned runners.
> 'Athletes from this one tribe of 3 million people have won 40 percent of all the highest international honors
> available in men's distance running,' in track, cross-country, and road racing.
