Say what you will about our love...

... But nothing can come between a sasquatch and his pine.

I saw this on the wall at a rehearsal studio in San Francisco. I just had to
take a picture and share it. I should just make a blog of the things people
write on the walls in rehearsal studios. Seriously.

I would love it if someone found this and claimed it as their own.
