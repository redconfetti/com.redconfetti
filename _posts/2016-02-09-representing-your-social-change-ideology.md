I think anyone who claims to be part of any ideological group, especially those
advocating social / cultural change, should clarify that the movement doesn't
have a centralized membership roster that they control. You can't excommunicate
someone who claims to be a feminist, even when they represents feminism in a
distorted and/or immature manner due to ignorance of the true points or any
other reason.

It's very understandable that men doubt feminists, because sometimes what they
mean isn't totally clear in their expressions. I seriously think feminists need
to be impeccable with what they say, or else the people who hear them may
misinterpret what they mean. This is why the "not all men" argument loop comes
up so often, because women assume that people know they're not talking about all
men, but seriously... I did not. When talking about subjects such as subtle
sexism and/or racism, you really need to be exact about what you're talking
about.

You also need to be patient and willing to answer questions, even if they seem a
bit hostile, since you are choosing to represent an ideology and people may be
threatened by. People with this impression just need you to represent that it's
not militant or hostile. You can clarify that of course at times you're going to
be angry, if you are a person that is being marginalized. When it becomes clear
that you're not talking to an open minded person, you can choose to walk away,
but give some people a chance if they seem to be asking questions neutrally and
with sincere curiosity.

Telling people that it's not your responsibility to educate them on subtle
cultural issues and their effects, right after you claim that they exist and are
very important, is how you get people to distrust and disrespect you.
