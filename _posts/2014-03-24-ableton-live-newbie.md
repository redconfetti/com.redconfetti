In the past I've developed music using the IK Multimedia's
[Total Studio bundle][] combined with [Cubase][]. The fruits of those
efforts resulted in a number of tracks that I've posted in my [Music
section](/music/) from 2007/2008.

I moved to Berkeley, California in 2009, dabbling with music a bit using
Garageband, and later again [some more tracks](http://music.redconfetti.com/)
using Cubase.

More recently I noticed the artist [Kawehi on Facebook][] and her cover of
[Heart Shaped Box][] on Vimeo. Later I noticed that she did a cover of
[Closer][] by Nine Inch Nails.

[Kawehi](http://vimeo.com/iamkawehi) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

The settings she records in are very iconic, but it's her little gadgets, and
her ability to sample on the fly to compose the song right before your eyes,
that grabs my attention. She doesn't use a looper pedal that loses the volume of
the first sample you recorded slowly over time. I'm inspired.

A couple months ago I bought a copy of Ableton Live 9 Intro, and now this is
really influencing me to learn it and start making music again. One thing that
has always been a weak spot for me is arrangement, and it looks like the
flexibility and swiftness available for arranging a song with Ableton is so much
more supportive than the typical horizontal timeline of ProTools, Cubase, Logic,
etc.

Over the weekend I went to Guitar Center and picked up a book,
[Ableton Live 9 Power!][]. So far the book has been really helpful.
Ableton Live seems like a totally
different interface than I'm used to, and I'm not wanting any blockages to
making progress with the program, so investing in a nice book is worth it, even
though I've usually winged it in the past.

I also bought an [Akai MPK Mini][] ($100).
I thought this was the same thing Kawehi used in her Heart Shaped Box video, but
it looks like she's actually using an [M-Audio Axiom AIR Mini 32][] that retails
for about the same price.

I was just looking through some of the other MIDI interfaces that complement
Ableton Live really well. It looks like the other thing Kawehi uses is a
[Novation Launchpad][]. She is either using the [Launchpad S][], which goes for
about $150, or the [Launchpad Mini][], which goes for $100.

Some other MIDI controllers that I might consider to complement or replace the
MPK Mini are Akai's [APC20][] (retails for $200) or [APC40][]. Or ultimately,
the new [Push interface][] (retails for $600, [$565 on Amazon][])
seems to be the creme de la creme currently.
