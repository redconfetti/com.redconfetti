If you have a limited budget and want to get the tools you need for music
production, here's a list of free plugins that will work for Mac or PC.

## Effects

### Bundle

* [Air Windows Consolidated][] - A single plugin that provides multiple plugin
  types (Clipping, Distortion, Dynamics, Filter, Noise, Reverb, etc). Hundreds
  of plugins. See [APMastering Free Plugins Video][]

### Dynamics

This category includes compressors and limiters, used to shape the volume of
tracks. A very essential music production tool for those that know how to use it.

I highly recommend this 10 hour video on compression -
[How to Use Compression][]. You can learn so much with just the first 3 hours of
the video. I highly recommend watching just a bit at a time to take everything
in.

Honestly you should be able to get by with the compressors included with your
DAW, but these are free and might provide more options.

## Modular Synths

I recommend that anyone wanting to understand synthesizers learn the basics
of patching up a subtractive synthesizer, similar to the Minimoog, to understand
how synthesizers are really wired internally. It will make it so that when
you see a non-modular synthesizer, you'll be able to guess how it works much
easier instead of being mystified and confused.

* [Cardinal] - Modular software synth based on [VCVRack]. See my video,
  [Subtractive Synthesis for Beginners Tutorial with Cardinal][] if you need
  help understanding how to use Cardinal.
