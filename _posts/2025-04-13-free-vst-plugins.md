I'm trying to get a friend into music production, but they don't have a budget
for expensive software.

Here is a list of plugins I compiled for them to install.

* Blamsoft
  * [VK-1 Viking][] - Classic monophonic analog synthesizer. This is a great
    start for those wanting to learn classic subtractive synthesis such as that
    provided by the Mini Moog
* Cherry Audio
  * [Surrealistic MG-1 Plus Synthesizer][] - Based on the
    [Realistic Concertmate MG-1][], it's like a RadioShack MiniMoog. It doesn't
    have all the capability of the MiniMoog, but still simple and charming.
* u-He
  * [Triple Cheese][]
  * [Zebralette][] - Easy spectral synth
  * [Tyrell N6][] - Virtual analogue with classic architecture plus extras
  * [Poldoski][] - Virtual analogue synthesizer
* DSP56300
  * [Osirus][] - Access Virus A/B/C emulation
  * [OsTIrus][] - Access Virus TI/TI2/Snow emulation
  * [Vavra][] - Waldorf MicroQ emulation
  * [Xenia][] - Waldorf Microwave II/XT emulation
* Surge
  * [Surge XT][]
* TAL
  * [Tal Noisemaker][]
* The Wave Warden
  * [Odin 2][]
* One Small Clue
  * [Poise: Percussion Sampler][] - This will satisfy those needing a percussion
    sampler for drums
* Vital
  * [Vital] - Wavetable / Additive synth
