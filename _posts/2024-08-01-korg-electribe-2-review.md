I've decided that my second attempt at finding a good match for me is going to
be directed at the [Korg Electribe v2][], also known as as the [EMX-2][] in the
UK.

[Korg Electribe v2]: https://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/electribe/
[EMX-2]: https://www.korg.co.uk/collections/production-stations/products/emx2/

I fell in love with the music I heard demonstrated with its predecessor, the
Electribe EMX-1. In fact I have one of those ordered and on its way in the mail
right now.

But I really like the size of the Electribe v2, and that it's battery powered.
I imagine myself pulling it out of my backpack in a little carrying case,
along with a pair of headphones, or even a portable speaker and auxillary cable.

Reviews of it I've seen online give it praise in a manner that gives
me the impression that short of the tube saturation included with the EMX-1,
its capabilities are comparable, so I'm going to give it a go.
