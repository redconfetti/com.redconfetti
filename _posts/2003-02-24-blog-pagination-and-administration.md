I've added the NEXT/PREV links to the main blog page...and they appear to work
just fine now. Next I'm going to add them to the administration section.

Also I had a problem password-protecting the administration section, however I
just sent in a request to Liquidpages to activate HTACCESS on the administration
directories for my blog, as well as Marshall's.
