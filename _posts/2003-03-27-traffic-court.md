Oh yeah...I forgot to add that I went to traffic court today. I paid $175 for a lawyer to represent me, and he just
talked to the judge and it was settled immediately. I just have to pay $90 (original ticket fee) + $35 in court costs,
and I have no points on my license. I've got two more court dates, and I hope they are settled without any points on my
license as well.
