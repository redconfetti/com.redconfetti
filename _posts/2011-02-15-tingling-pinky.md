    Hi Rachael. I started to wear a wrist brace when I slept at night, and this helped greatly. I think that my wrist or arm would contort in stressful ways when I slept, like a muscular cramping in response to the new events such as using the clutch on my motorcycle extensively. The wrist brace stopped this from happening too much.

    I also went a massage therapist that did work on my arms, specifically the forearms, and this contributed to the issues with sensation in my hand going away.

  content: "glad i found your website, and reference to sensations on little finger
    side of palm. every other online search goes straight into carpel tunnel syndrome
    affecting other side of hand. \r\n\r\ncan only describe feeling in palm as rippling.
    feels like i have something moving under my palm. also wake in night with pain
    between elbow and wrist. sleep like i'm in a cocoon so will try and sleep tonight
    with my elbow straight. and take more breaks from the computer too."

    time period?  I have had this issue for 4 days now, and it has really started
    to bother me.  I slept last night with my neck straight as possible and my arm
    straight hoping that the tingling would disappear, but it is still present.  Did
    either of you two get it to go away?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    My problem went away after a couple weeks, but like I said I tried various things to alleviate the tingling (wrist brace, massage, sleeping position). Also getting used to the motorcycle clutch was part of this.
    Has anything changed in your life, anything new that might put stress or cause changes in your neck, shoulders, or arms, which might be putting pressure on nerves?

  content: I believe there is no such thing as reetlsss leg syndrome but I've never
    experienced it so I suppose I can't say for sure. I DO know; however, that one
    of you was correct when you stated that Doctors are now sales people. I usually
    interview my doctors at first initial viist and can tell in a brief period of
    time whether or not that doctor is going to be mine. I actually tell them, I'm
    interviewing them not the other way around. If they have an attitude about it,
    they are not the one for me. If they have that kind of an attitude, then I think
    they've got something to hide. As far as RLS, listen things could be much worse
    you could have malignant cancer. A lot of things in life are annoying, I don't
    mean to invalidate your feelings but it just seems to me yet another diagnosis
    of something else they can add to the pot of prescription medicines to add to
    thier tally at the end of the week meaning more $$$ dollar signs. I keep things
    simple in my life. I DO visit the doctor when necessary but only when very necessary.
    I don't visit for sniffles so I can get put on antibiotics like millions of other
    people in the world and I try and keep my body in shape, inside and out. I eat
    healthy foods (non processed) and eat whole organic foods only and no red meat
    but very rarely (I'd say once every 6 months) I don't get enough iron so I take
    a supplment. I figure anything homeopathic worked for native american indians
    and our forefathers before us will work for us now. I'd be real careful about
    medications that docs prescribe unless they themselves have been on it for sometime.
    I don't want to be their guinea pig. Obviously, on occasion people HAVE to take
    a medication to help if they have cancer but i've heard of people who just changed
    their diet and the cancer was put into remission. Does it happen to everyone,
    no but it never hurts to both western medicine accompanied with homeopathic remedies
    (make sure, of course there is no contraindications with the two you can do that
    by asking the pharmacist they would know more about that then your doc anyway)
    Contrary to popular belief, Doctors are human and are prone to making mistakes.
    In the end, we are responsible for our own body, what we put into it and what
    we want to get out of it by eating healthy and nutritious foods and taking our
    vitamins. Good luck in your research. I would look for a homeopathic remedy first
    regarding the RLS. You never know what you may find. In the meantime, God Bless
    and Get Well.

I noticed recently that my pinky finger, the meat of the palm just below it on
the front, and half of my ringer finger, on the right hand, have a tingling
sensation as if they have fallen asleep. No pain, no "pins and needles". Just a
lack of clear sensation when gripping something with those fingers, especially
shampooing my hair in the morning.

The first thing I thought was that [Carpel Tunnel
Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome) (CTS) that is
common amongst people who use a computer like I do 8 hours a day for the last
15+ years. I looked into this however and found that CTS only affects the [other
portions of my
hand](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/1081.htm).

![carpal tunnel syndrome]({{site.assets.url_prefix}}/images/posts/carpal-tunnel-syndrome.jpg "carpal tunnel syndrome")

So there must be something less intense with a different nerve going on here,
and not the median nerve. It turns out that in my case it's the ulnar nerve that
is being pinched or something. I read the article on wikipedia on [ulnar nerve
entrapment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve_entrapment) and at first
read the description of [Guyon's Canal
Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyon%27s_canal_syndrome). This really
freaked me out because it mentioned bicycling, and a possible situation where I
lose strength in the fingers and form an [ulnar
claw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_claw). I ride a bicycle to work every
day, then sit in front of a computer...plus if you read my last post you'll see
I just got a new motorcycle. I definitely don't want to be put on a no-bike time
out. Plus the symptoms sounded horrible.

Well, as I rode my bike home last night I paid attention to how I leaned over on
the bike. I distribute my weight evenly over the handlebars and seat, and don't
lean on one handlebar more than the other. To do so would cause me to turn to
the right instead of riding in a straight line. I couldn't understand how this
would cause stress, other than perhaps the angle of my arm in relation to my
hand.

Also, the previous weekend when I had gone to a motorcycle riders course, my
left hand was getting tired, sore, and then numb from holding a difficult clutch
in when we were idling and waiting to let out the clutch to move forward in 1st
gear. This made me wonder if perhaps my right hand was being stressed somehow
from the new angle which I held the throttle on the motorcycle. I didn't notice
any stress on the right hand though the previous weekend, it was the left.

The only other possibility I could think of would be how I sleep at night. I
sleep on my stomach with my right arm under the pillow, and my head rested on
the pillow right above my right shoulder. Sometimes I switch to the left arm,
but I tend to sleep on the right with my face pointed to the left. Well, last
night I tried to sleep on my left shoulder/arm instead, but ended up switching
back to the right in the middle of the night. I woke up at one point and noticed
that the right hand was more numb and tingly than it is during the day. Bingo!
It looks like this is caused by [Cubital Tunnel
Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve_entrapment#Cubital_Tunnel_Syndrome).
I guess some call this 'Cell Phone Elbow Syndrome'.

[<img title="cubital-tunnel-syndrome" src="{{site.assets.url_prefix}}/images/posts/cubital-tunnel-syndrome.jpg" alt="" width="300" />](http://www.thepicky.com/gadgets/what-is-cell-phone-elbow-syndrome/)

> __Cubital tunnel syndrome__ occurs when the ulnar nerve is obstructed during
its path along the [cubital
tunnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubital_tunnel); the outer edge of the
elbow. This compression of the nerve often leads to a tingling or 'pins and
needles' sensation in the little and ring fingers. Most cases will be minor and
tend to come and go with time. Common causes are sleeping with the arm folded
up, so the hand is at the person's neck and the elbow is sharply bent. These
people frequently wake up with tingling in the fingers, because the nerve has
been pinched or squeezed while asleep. Treatment of these types of causes are
easy to remedy and can involve simply altering sleeping positions to avoid
aggravating the elbow area. In more extreme cases however where tingling is
persistent, surgery is an option to move the nerve away from the area

Shew! I really dodged one there.
