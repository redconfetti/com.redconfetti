I remember when my 4th grade teacher sent me home with a note to my parents recommending that I take Ritalin. This
isn't how you solve the problem. It's likely the sugar and carbs in the child's diet that make them hyperactive, or
the television that makes them unable to focus, or the environment at home that causes them to behave a certain way.
