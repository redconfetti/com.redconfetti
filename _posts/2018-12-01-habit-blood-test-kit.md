This morning I began going through the [Habit.com](https://habit.com/) blood
test after fasting for 10 hours. I followed the instructions and used the lancet
in the middle of the meat of my ring finger. I tried to warm my hands before
hand and even tried to encourage blood flow.

The blood harly flowed though. It was extremely hard to get a drop to form, let
alone let it slide down my finger directly into the little square.

I pulled out the second card, a second lancet, and tried again using my middle
finger. I put on a sweater, and started doing jumpking jacks, to encourage blood
flow. Yet again, it was extremely difficult to get a drop to form. I started to
get some, but because the prick was in the middle of the finger, I accidentally
smeared the good drop I had worked so furiously to create all over my finger.

It was a mess. It was frustrating. I was now worried that I had no extra cards,
nor lancets, to finish test one.

I then looked online and found this video with instructions.

It turns out that if you prick your finger near the tip, and to the side,
the blood can flow much more freely. In the video the woman claims that it is
where the best capillaries are located for obtaining a blood specimen.

I noticed there were 2 extra lancets located in a side pouch of the test kit
box. I used one of these from the side near the tip of the finger. This allowed
me to press down on the meat of the finger, effectively promoting the blood
flow. Since the prick was near the tip of the finger, it came out and turned
into drops I could easily aim into the little square of the test card.

I hope this post helps others that end up having the same frustration and turn
to the internet for some guidance.
