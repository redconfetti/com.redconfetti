Wow. It seems like destiny. I surfed around and found a shop in San Francisco that has a used 2009 Suzuki GS500F with
the black/red/grey colored fairing I wanted.

Everything I've [read](http://www.topspeed.com/motorcycles/motorcycle-reviews/suzuki/2010-suzuki-gs500f-ar45565.html)
and heard about this machine tell me that this is the bike for me.

I love the sporty look and the upright/standard seating style. It has a 487cc engine, which is powerful enough for a
person of my size and weight but also good as a starter bike. It appears that the engine hasn't changed much over 30
years, so repairs shouldn't be costly if needed.

I've paid $200 for SF Moto to hold the bike for me. I go check it out tomorrow morning.

Update: I bought it. It's mine!
