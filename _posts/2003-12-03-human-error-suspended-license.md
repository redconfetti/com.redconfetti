Its funny how I've lost all care for Myst/Uru. Recently I pulled out of Bryant's
plans to play a gig under his band "Human Error". I didn't feel right
contributing the music I've developed for "Redconfetti" to his act, and even
more than that I can't produce lyrics and music in just a month or so just to
play a gig.

On another note. I'm finally taking initiative to take care of my suspended
license. I called the courthouse and made sure to know which class I need to
take exactly. Now I just need to call various traffic schools and see if they
offer the "Alive at 25" class I have to take.

Time to go to bed...after I talk to a few people.
