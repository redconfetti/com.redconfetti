As part of my aim to switch to a healthier lifestyle. I'm trying to cook using more vegetables. Tonight I'm having
crab cakes with brown rice, diakon raddish, carrots, steamed greens (spinach, mustard, collard, turnip), and some
boiled yams. It's the first time I've made yams myself. I was surprised that they are white, not yellow like they
typically are.
