Well. I bought the SQL book I've been planning to buy. I've been touching up and
commenting the code for this blog, so I can set one up for Marshall. Tuna's on
his way over. I agreed to watch a movie with him, and let him have a Doc's
Hard Lemon or Daniels Hard Cola. He's leaving right after the movie, and I'm
going to start reading this SQL book.

I'm trying to get excited about programming again. This is my goal, and its more
important than philosophy right now. Philosophy doesn't pay the bills.

I also setup a streaming audio server today using SHOUTcast.
